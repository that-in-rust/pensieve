we will note down all the concepts that we are learning in this project

let's start with what scares us the most:
async programming in rust


Imagine you're playing a video game and need to load a big map.
With a normal function, the game would freeze until loading finishes.
But with async, the game keeps running while the map loads in the background!

That's why we use async here - reading ZIP files can be slow,
but we don't want to freeze the whole program while we wait.
The async function lets other code run while we're reading the ZIP.

Normal:     Async:
  [WAIT]      [Other]
  [WAIT]  vs  [Other]
  [WAIT]      [Other]
  [Done]      [Done]
