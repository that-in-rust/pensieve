### 🏔️ Understanding Structs in Rust: A Pyramid Approach

#### 1. **Base Level: Basic Struct**
*Think of a struct as a simple blueprint for creating objects, like an outline for a character in a story.*

```rust
struct Wizard {
    name: String,  // 🧙‍♂️ Wizard's Name
    age: u32,      // 🎂 Wizard's Age
}

fn main() {
    let gandalf = Wizard {
        name: String::from("Gandalf"),
        age: 2019,
    };
    println!("Name: {}, Age: {}", gandalf.name, gandalf.age);
}
```

#### 2. **Middle Level: Struct with Methods**
*Building upon the basic struct, methods allow structs to have behaviors, making them more dynamic.*

```rust
struct Wizard {
    name: String,  // 🧙‍♂️ Wizard's Name
    age: u32,      // 🎂 Wizard's Age
}

impl Wizard {
    fn cast_spell(&self, spell: &str) {
        println!("{} casts {}!", self.name, spell);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let merlin = Wizard {
        name: String::from("Merlin"),
        age: 150,
    };
    merlin.cast_spell("Invisibility");
}
```

#### 3. **Top Level: Advanced Structs with Traits**
*At the pinnacle, structs can interact with traits, enabling polymorphic behavior and enhanced functionality.*

```rust
trait Magic {
    fn cast(&self);
}

struct Sorcerer {
    name: String,  // 🧙‍♂️ Sorcerer's Name
    age: u32,      // 🎂 Sorcerer's Age
}

impl Magic for Sorcerer {
    fn cast(&self) {
        println!("{} casts a powerful spell!", self.name);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let druid = Sorcerer {
        name: String::from("Druidia"),
        age: 300,
    };
    druid.cast();
}
```

### Pros and Cons of Structs in Rust vs Java

#### Pros of Rust Structs:
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership model ensures memory safety without a garbage collector.
- **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions provide high performance comparable to low-level languages.
- **Pattern Matching**: Easily deconstruct structs using Rust's powerful pattern matching.
- **Custom Implementations**: Implement methods and traits to extend functionality seamlessly.

#### Cons of Rust Structs:
- **Verbosity**: More boilerplate when defining traits and implementations compared to Java.
- **Learning Curve**: Ownership and borrowing concepts can be challenging for those familiar with Java.

#### Comparison to Java Classes:
- **Similarity**: Both are used to define custom data types with fields and methods.
- **Difference**: Rust structs do not support inheritance; polymorphism is achieved through traits.
- **Memory Management**: Java relies on garbage collection, whereas Rust uses ownership and borrowing for memory management.
- **Concurrency**: Rust provides fearless concurrency with its ownership model, reducing data races.

 // Start of Selection
 - **Memory Management:** Rust uses an ownership and borrowing model to manage memory, providing safety without a garbage collector. In contrast, Java relies on garbage collection for memory management.
 
 - **Inheritance:** Rust doesn't support inheritance directly but achieves similar functionality through traits. On the other hand, Java supports inheritance and the use of interfaces for polymorphism.
 
 - **Performance:** Rust offers zero-cost abstractions, meaning the abstractions don't incur runtime overhead. Java, running on the JVM, introduces some performance overhead due to just-in-time compilation and garbage collection.
 
 - **Polymorphism:** In Rust, polymorphism is achieved through traits, allowing for flexible and reusable code. Java achieves polymorphism using inheritance and interfaces, enabling objects to be treated as instances of their superclass or interface.
 
 - **Syntax:** Rust uses `struct` definitions combined with `impl` blocks and traits to define behavior, whereas Java utilizes classes with methods and inheritance to encapsulate data and functionality.
