FIX MISSING stuff and required updates ASAP - DO NOT ASK JUST UPDATE IN @ref06currentErrorLog.txt 

FIRST IDENTIFY THE DIFFERENCES IN  @ref03archL2.txt AND THEN CHANGE  AS PER NEW PRD @ref01prd.txt

NOW CHANGE  WITH MINIMAL CHANGES TO WHAT IS ALREADY RELEVANT - DO NOT DELETE UNNECESSARY STUFF


ONLY CHANGE VERY LIMITED PARTS OF @ref03archL2.txt  AS PER @ref02archL1.txt  - BE VERY SLOW - CHECK EACH THING AND THEN CHANGE MINIMAL PARTS SO LEARNINGS ARE NOT LOST
