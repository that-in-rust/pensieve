Default questions to ask for each concept:
    - What is this concept in ELI15
    - Give a simple runnable example of this concept in Java
    - Why was this concept needed in Java when this was designed as a language/framework feature
    - Do we have a similar concept in Rust
    - If Yes, then how is it different from Java concept
    - Give 1 simple runnable example of this concept in Rust
    - If no, then why did Rust not choose to implement this concept
    - What functional need does this concept fulfill in Java, and since it is not there in Rust how does Rust achieve the same functionality

[] Append to this are there any other ways apart from Stack and heap - and which languages would use it  - I always see only Stack Heap in Rust

[] Unable to visualize a mental model for this unlike Heap or Stack which - can you draw all 3 in style of @visualASCII202410.txt 

[] How is Data Segment different than Heap or Stack - what are the Pros Cons of using it and not using it - tell specially smart use cases in context of Senior Engineering interviews which can make me sound impressive - use @Web  if needed 

[] Append - does this mean Data Segment is packed in binary - as opposed to stack heap which are runtime allocations?

[] How is this different from Java and how does it impact the ecosystem - what was the reason for language design
