## L1-L8 Extraction Hierarchy Analysis

### A Alone: Core Document Analysis

**Document**: Hermione's Approximations: A Strategic Analysis of Product-Market Fit and Technical Implementation

This is a comprehensive strategic document proposing a Rust library for rational function approximation (Padé approximants). The document demonstrates sophisticated understanding of both mathematical foundations and market positioning.

#### Horizon 1: Tactical Implementation (The "How")

**L1: Idiomatic Patterns & Micro-Optimizations**
- **Barrett Reduction**: Document mentions implementing Barrett reduction for modular arithmetic - a sophisticated optimization showing deep understanding of CPU-level performance
- **Continued Fraction Optimization**: R4,4(x) approximation for cos(x) requires 12 operations in standard form but only 7 in continued fraction form - demonstrates mechanical sympathy
- **SIMD Awareness**: Multi-layered optimization strategy considering CPU architecture from low-level arithmetic to high-level parallelism
- **Memory Layout Consciousness**: Focus on cache-friendly data structures and arithmetic optimization

**L2: Design Patterns & Composition (Meta-Patterns)**
- **Trait-Based Architecture**: Every component depends on traits, not concrete types (dependency injection pattern)
- **RAII Resource Management**: All resources automatically managed with Drop implementations
- **Layered Architecture**: L1 (core) → L2 (std) → L3 (external) boundaries clearly defined
- **Error Handling Hierarchy**: thiserror for libraries, anyhow for applications

**L3: Micro-Library Opportunities**
- **hermione-control**: Numerically stable time-delay models for embedded systems
- **hermione-ml**: Rational Activation Functions for neural networks with gradient computation
- **hermione-cli**: Code generation tool for game developers
- **Padé Table Analysis Utilities**: Diagnostic tools for function approximation quality

#### Horizon 2: Strategic Architecture (The "What")

**L4: Macro-Library & Platform Opportunities**

- **Cross-Domain Platform**: Scientific computing, embedded systems, game development, and machine learning
- **Performance-First Rust Ecosystem Play**: Filling gap between slow Python tools and unsafe C++ implementations

**L5: LLD Architecture Decisions & Invariants**
- **Numerical Stability as Core Invariant**: Cascaded 1st/2nd-order systems instead of ill-conditioned high-order polynomials
- **Multi-Algorithm Support**: Linear systems, extended Euclidean algorithm, Wynn's epsilon algorithm
- **Precision vs Performance Trade-offs**: Different algorithms for different use cases

**L6: Domain-Specific Architecture & Hardware Interaction**
- **Control Systems Integration**: State-space representations for real-time systems
- **GPU Shader Code Generation**: GLSL/HLSL output for graphics applications
- **ML Framework Integration**: PyTorch/TensorFlow bindings via PyO3

## Key Rust Patterns Extracted

### 1. Performance-First Library Design
```rust
// Implied pattern from document
pub trait RationalApproximant<T> {
    fn evaluate(&self, x: T) -> T;
    fn continued_fraction_form(&self) -> ContinuedFraction<T>;
    fn error_bound(&self, interval: (T, T)) -> T;
}
```

### 2. Domain-Specific Killer Features
```rust
// Control systems stability pattern
pub fn stable_delay<T>(p: usize, q: usize, delay_time: T) -> StateSpaceModel<T>
where T: Float + Send + Sync;

// ML integration pattern  
pub struct RationalActivation<T> {
    numerator_coeffs: Vec<T>,
    denominator_coeffs: Vec<T>,
}
```

### 3. Multi-Algorithm Architecture
```rust
pub enum ApproximationMethod {
    LinearSystem,
    ExtendedEuclidean,
    WynnsEpsilon,
    Remez { max_iterations: usize },
}
```
