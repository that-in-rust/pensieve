# Parseltongue AIM Daemon - Feature Backlog

## Post-MVP 1.0 Features

This document contains advanced features and requirements that are valuable but beyond the scope of MVP 1.0. These should be considered for future releases after the core functionality is proven and stable.

## Advanced Requirements (Post-MVP)

### Requirement 19: Advanced Technical Implementation (v2.0)
**User Story:** As a Rust developer requiring enterprise-grade architectural intelligence, I want advanced technical implementation patterns using lock-free data structures and performance optimization techniques, so that the daemon can achieve maximum throughput and minimal latency for production-scale Rust development.

**Moved to Backlog Reason:** Lock-free data structures, SIMD operations, and memory-mapped files are complex optimizations that should come after MVP validation.

### Requirement 20: Extensibility and Reliability (v2.0)
**User Story:** As a Rust developer working with extensible architectural intelligence systems, I want plugin architecture and configurable components that support future enhancements while maintaining performance, so that the daemon can evolve with changing Rust ecosystem needs.

**Moved to Backlog Reason:** Plugin architecture and extensibility are important for long-term success but add complexity that could delay MVP delivery.

### Requirement 21: Intelligent File Discovery (v1.5)
**User Story:** As a Rust developer working with complex project structures, I want intelligent file discovery and monitoring that automatically detects Rust source files and workspace configurations, so that the daemon can seamlessly integrate with any Rust project without manual configuration.

**Moved to Backlog Reason:** While useful, automatic project detection can be simplified for MVP - users can specify source directories manually.

### Requirement 22: Advanced SigHash and Verification (v2.0)
**User Story:** As a Rust developer requiring advanced architectural intelligence features, I want sophisticated SigHash generation, machine-readable specifications, and property-based verification, so that the daemon can provide enterprise-grade analysis capabilities with mathematical precision.

**Moved to Backlog Reason:** BLAKE3 hashing, JSONL export, and property-based testing are advanced features that can be added after core functionality works.

### Requirement 23: Code Convention Validation (v1.5)
**User Story:** As a Rust developer following strict code conventions, I want the daemon to recognize and validate established Rust patterns and conventions, so that architectural analysis aligns with best practices and coding standards.

**Moved to Backlog Reason:** Pattern validation is valuable but not essential for core architectural intelligence. Can be added as enhancement.

### Requirement 24: Advanced Daemon Capabilities (v3.0)
**User Story:** As a Rust developer requiring comprehensive architectural intelligence, I want advanced real-time daemon capabilities with multi-source input handling and sophisticated query optimization, so that the system can provide enterprise-grade analysis with millisecond response times across diverse Rust codebases.

**Moved to Backlog Reason:** Multi-source merging, streaming parsers, and enterprise-scale features are complex and should come after MVP proves the core concept.

##
 Critical Scope Reduction (Based on Technical Review)

**Analysis**: The original MVP scope was overloaded with v2.0 features that would prevent successful delivery. The following requirements have been moved to ensure MVP focuses on core ISG functionality.

### Moved Due to Architectural Conflicts

#### SQLite Storage Conflict (RESOLVED)
- **Original**: REQ-MVP-006.0 mandated SQLite storage
- **Problem**: SQLite cannot meet sub-millisecond graph traversal requirements
- **Resolution**: Updated to use OptimizedISG in-memory architecture with rkyv snapshotting
- **Technical Basis**: Prior architectural analysis proved SQLite incompatible with performance targets

#### Concurrency Model Conflicts (RESOLVED)  
- **Original**: Requirements specified conflicting Arc<RwLock<T>>, Arc<Mutex<T>>, and DashMap
- **Problem**: Mutex bottlenecks reads, DashMap adds synchronization complexity
- **Resolution**: Standardized on single Arc<RwLock<ISGState>> (parking_lot::RwLock)
- **Technical Basis**: OptimizedISG architecture requires atomic consistency

### Moved Due to Scope Overload

#### Advanced Static Analysis Features → v2.0
- **REQ-RUST-001.0**: Idiomatic Pattern Recognition (newtype validation, ownership analysis)
- **REQ-TDD-001.0**: Testing Pattern Detection (property-based test recognition)
- **Reason**: These describe an advanced static analyzer like Clippy, requiring deep semantic understanding beyond structural ISG
- **MVP Focus**: Structure only (who calls what, who implements what)

#### Network APIs and LSP → v2.0  
- **REQ-API-001.0**: HTTP/gRPC server, Language Server Protocol, 1000 concurrent connections
- **Reason**: LSP is massive undertaking, network serving adds complexity
- **MVP Focus**: CLI sufficient for both human and LLM consumption (via --format json)

#### Advanced Rule Engines → v2.0
- **REQ-QUAL-001.0**: Architectural debt detection, health metrics over time
- **REQ-ARCH-003.0**: Advanced constraint validation, domain rule enforcement
- **Reason**: Requires configuration and rule engine, MVP should provide raw data
- **MVP Focus**: Basic queries (find-cycles, blast-radius) without interpretation

#### Multi-Source Complexity → v3.0
- **REQ-ARCH-002.0**: Multi-source graph merging (LiveFS + Dumps + Git simultaneously)
- **Reason**: Deterministic conflict resolution across sources is highly complex
- **MVP Focus**: Analyze one source at a time (EITHER live directory OR dump file)

### Technical Corrections Applied

#### Parsing Strategy Simplified
- **Original**: REQ-RUST-002.0 AC 6 relied on rustdoc JSON for edge cases
- **Problem**: Heavy external dependencies, operational complexity
- **Resolution**: MVP uses syn exclusively, gracefully skips unparseable constructs

#### Code Dump Formats Simplified
- **Original**: REQ-FUNC-004.0 AC 6 supported tar.gz, zip, git bundles
- **Problem**: Adds unnecessary complexity
- **Resolution**: Support only separated dump format (FILE: markers)

#### Technical Terminology Fixed
- **"Rust's garbage collection"** → **"compact in-memory structures"** (Rust has no GC)
- **"SigHash compression"** → **"optimized data structures"** (hashes can't compress)
- **"struct inheritance patterns"** → **"trait inheritance"** (Rust has no classical inheritance)

## Revised Leaner MVP Scope

The MVP now focuses exclusively on core ISG functionality:

1. **REQ-MVP-001.0**: Code Dump Ingestion (separated format only)
2. **REQ-MVP-002.0**: Live Codebase Monitoring (<12ms updates)  
3. **REQ-MVP-003.0**: Essential Graph Queries (<1ms latency)
4. **REQ-MVP-004.0**: LLM Context Generation (via CLI)
5. **REQ-MVP-005.0**: Essential CLI Interface
6. **REQ-MVP-006.0**: In-Memory Performance (OptimizedISG + snapshotting)
7. **REQ-MVP-007.0**: Essential Error Handling

**Result**: Technically aligned with OptimizedISG architecture, achievable scope, validates core hypothesis of deterministic sub-millisecond architectural intelligence.
