# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables ingesting source code files into a PostgreSQL database with structured storage, indexing, and querying capabilities. The system will parse various programming languages, extract metadata, and store code in a searchable format optimized for code analysis, documentation generation, and development tooling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ingest source code files into a PostgreSQL database, so that I can perform structured queries and analysis on my codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the ingestion command with a directory path THEN the system SHALL recursively scan all supported source code files
2. WHEN processing each file THEN the system SHALL extract file metadata (path, size, modification time, language)
3. WHEN parsing source code THEN the system SHALL identify and extract structural elements (functions, classes, imports, comments)
4. WHEN storing in PostgreSQL THEN the system SHALL use normalized tables for efficient querying and indexing
5. WHEN ingestion completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report of processed files and extracted elements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to support multiple programming languages, so that I can analyze polyglot codebases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering Rust files (.rs) THEN the system SHALL parse functions, structs, enums, traits, and modules
2. WHEN encountering Python files (.py) THEN the system SHALL parse functions, classes, imports, and docstrings
3. WHEN encountering JavaScript/TypeScript files (.js, .ts) THEN the system SHALL parse functions, classes, interfaces, and exports
4. WHEN encountering unsupported file types THEN the system SHALL store basic metadata without parsing
5. WHEN adding new language support THEN the system SHALL use a pluggable parser architecture

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient database schema design, so that queries perform well on large codebases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the schema THEN the system SHALL use separate tables for files, functions, classes, and other code elements
2. WHEN storing code content THEN the system SHALL support both full-text search and structured queries
3. WHEN indexing data THEN the system SHALL create indexes on commonly queried fields (file paths, function names, language types)
4. WHEN handling large files THEN the system SHALL support chunked storage for files exceeding size limits
5. WHEN querying relationships THEN the system SHALL maintain foreign key relationships between code elements and their containing files

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want incremental updates, so that I can re-ingest modified codebases efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN re-ingesting a directory THEN the system SHALL detect modified files using timestamps and checksums
2. WHEN a file is unchanged THEN the system SHALL skip processing to improve performance
3. WHEN a file is modified THEN the system SHALL update existing records rather than creating duplicates
4. WHEN a file is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove corresponding database records
5. WHEN conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable ingestion options, so that I can customize the process for different projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specifying file patterns THEN the system SHALL support include/exclude glob patterns
2. WHEN setting parsing depth THEN the system SHALL allow limiting how deeply to parse code structures
3. WHEN configuring database connection THEN the system SHALL support connection strings and credential management
4. WHEN running in different modes THEN the system SHALL support dry-run, verbose, and batch processing options
5. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL provide configurable error handling (fail-fast vs continue-on-error)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want query capabilities, so that I can search and analyze the ingested code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching by function name THEN the system SHALL return matching functions with their file locations
2. WHEN searching by file path THEN the system SHALL support partial path matching and wildcards
3. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify import/export relationships between files
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide statistics on code metrics (file counts, function counts by language)
5. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support JSON and CSV export formats for further analysis
