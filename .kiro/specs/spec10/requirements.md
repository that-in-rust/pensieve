# Spec10: Large File Ingestion with Intelligent Chunking

## Introduction

This spec addresses the need to ingest large local folders containing massive files into PostgreSQL databases using the existing code-ingest tool. The focus is on handling files that are too large for standard processing by implementing intelligent chunking strategies while preserving context and queryability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Large File Ingestion

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to ingest large local folders with massive files into PostgreSQL, so that I can analyze huge datasets without memory constraints or processing failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run code-ingest on `/home/amuldotexe/Desktop/before-I-go/twitter-analysis-202509` THEN the system SHALL successfully process files regardless of size
2. WHEN files exceed memory limits THEN the system SHALL automatically chunk them into manageable segments
3. WHEN ingestion completes THEN all content SHALL be stored in `/home/amuldotexe/Desktop/before-I-go/postgresDB202509`
4. WHEN chunking occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve file relationships and context across chunks

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Chunking Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to intelligently chunk large files, so that the resulting database maintains queryability and context preservation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file exceeds the size threshold THEN the system SHALL analyze content structure before chunking
2. WHEN chunking text files THEN the system SHALL break at logical boundaries (paragraphs, sections, functions)
3. WHEN chunking structured data THEN the system SHALL preserve data integrity and relationships
4. WHEN creating chunks THEN each chunk SHALL include metadata linking it to the original file and adjacent chunks

### Requirement 3: Memory-Efficient Processing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the ingestion process to use memory efficiently, so that it can handle large datasets without system crashes or resource exhaustion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large files THEN memory usage SHALL remain below 100MB regardless of file size
2. WHEN multiple large files are processed THEN the system SHALL process them sequentially to avoid memory spikes
3. WHEN chunking occurs THEN only the current chunk SHALL be held in memory
4. WHEN ingestion fails due to memory THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 4: Chunk Metadata and Relationships

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to query across file chunks seamlessly, so that I can analyze content without worrying about artificial chunk boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are chunked THEN each chunk SHALL have metadata indicating its position in the original file
2. WHEN storing chunks THEN the system SHALL create relationship tables linking chunks to their parent files
3. WHEN querying chunked content THEN users SHALL be able to reconstruct original file content
4. WHEN searching across chunks THEN results SHALL indicate which chunks contain matches and their relationships

### Requirement 5: Progress Monitoring and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor ingestion progress and recover from failures, so that I can handle large datasets reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ingesting large folders THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress (files processed, chunks created, time remaining)
2. WHEN ingestion is interrupted THEN the system SHALL support resuming from the last successfully processed file
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and continue with remaining files
4. WHEN ingestion completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report of processed files and chunks

### Requirement 6: Database Schema for Chunked Content

**User Story:** As a database user, I want a clear schema for chunked content, so that I can write effective queries against large ingested datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chunked files are stored THEN the database SHALL have separate tables for file metadata and chunk content
2. WHEN chunks are created THEN each chunk SHALL have a unique identifier and parent file reference
3. WHEN querying is needed THEN the schema SHALL support efficient full-text search across all chunks
4. WHEN analyzing data THEN the schema SHALL provide views that reconstruct original files from chunks

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a power user, I want to configure chunking behavior, so that I can optimize ingestion for my specific data types and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring ingestion THEN users SHALL be able to set maximum chunk size (default: 10MB)
2. WHEN processing different file types THEN users SHALL be able to specify chunking strategies per file extension
3. WHEN handling structured data THEN users SHALL be able to define logical boundaries for chunking
4. WHEN optimizing performance THEN users SHALL be able to adjust memory limits and processing concurrency
