- [ ] Fix and make this spic and span by testing it for 1 particular small repo with file level + chunk size 50 + a folder path
    - run tree to find which documents might not be relevant or outdated and move them to zzArchive
    - Create new final documentation - minimalist basis the following actual tests
    - Run the ingestion for https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv - update READMELongForm20250929.md with exact results and command line reference - - Ingest PG Database to be stored at - /Users/neetipatni/desktop/PensieveDB01 - Result PG database to be stored at -  /Users/neetipatni/desktop/PensieveDB01
        - For the above ingestionTable generate tasks at file - name it well - should end as *tasks.md in /Users/neetipatni/Desktop/Game20250927/pensieve/.kiro/specs/S07-OperationalSpec-20250929
            - run for 3 files eye ball results - and confirm + update in READMELongForm20250929.md
        - Generate advanced tasks with 50 line chunk size at an appropriately named file - name it well - should end as *tasks.md in /Users/neetipatni/Desktop/Game20250927/pensieve/.kiro/specs/S07-OperationalSpec-20250929
            - run for 3 rows eye ball results - and confirm + update in READMELongForm20250929.md
    - Run ingestion for the folder /Users/neetipatni/Desktop/Game20250927/number-12-grimmauld-place/LibraryOfOrderOfThePhoenix - - Ingest PG Database to be stored at - /Users/neetipatni/desktop/PensieveDB01 - Result PG database to be stored at -  /Users/neetipatni/desktop/PensieveDB01
        - For the above ingestionTable generate tasks at file - name it well - should end as *tasks.md in /Users/neetipatni/Desktop/Game20250927/pensieve/.kiro/specs/S07-OperationalSpec-20250929
            - run for 3 files eye ball results - and confirm + update in READMELongForm20250929.md
        - Generate advanced tasks with 50 line chunk size at an appropriately named file - name it well - should end as *tasks.md in /Users/neetipatni/Desktop/Game20250927/pensieve/.kiro/specs/S07-OperationalSpec-20250929
            - run for 3 rows eye ball results - and confirm + update in READMELongForm20250929.md
    - Using Minto Pyramid Principle (essence first and details layer by layer) and twitter.com/amuldotexe 's low drama style, Create a fresh README.md file in root folder
        - Add Mermaid diagrams to make it more readable - use .kiro/MermaidRef20250929.md as a reference on creating the mermaid diagrams
    - Update whatever relevant stuff needs to be updated - be it Makefile or other imp docs
    - ✅ Summarize your whole task and your key learnings using minto pyramdid principle (essence first details layer by layer) in a Journal20250929.md in .journal/ 
    - ✅ make a commit for v0.2 and label it and push it to origin thanking the developers of Kiro for such a lovely product
    - ✅ Update README.md Using Minto Pyramid Principle (essence first and details layer by layer) and twitter.com/amuldotexe 's low drama style learning exclusively from READMELongForm20250929.md - make it focused on the user - put Mermaid diagrams using guidance of .kiro/MermaidRef20250929.md
    - ✅ Choose the right label given best practices - update it and push to origin (v0.2.1 - patch release for stability improvements)
