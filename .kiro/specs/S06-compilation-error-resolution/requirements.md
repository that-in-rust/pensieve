# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The code-ingest Rust codebase currently has 27 compilation errors preventing successful builds. These errors span multiple categories including missing imports, API changes in dependencies, ownership/borrowing issues, and type mismatches. This feature will systematically resolve all compilation errors to restore the codebase to a buildable state while maintaining existing functionality and following Rust best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to compile successfully without errors, so that I can build, test, and deploy the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `cargo build` THEN the system SHALL compile without any compilation errors
2. WHEN I run `cargo check` THEN the system SHALL report zero errors
3. WHEN compilation succeeds THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact
4. WHEN fixing errors THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for public APIs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dependency-related compilation errors resolved, so that the codebase works with current dependency versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing sysinfo dependency issues THEN the system SHALL use the correct API methods for the current version
2. WHEN resolving git2 dependency issues THEN the system SHALL use valid configuration options
3. WHEN updating dependency usage THEN the system SHALL follow the dependency's current best practices
4. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain the same functional behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ownership and borrowing errors resolved, so that the code follows Rust's memory safety principles correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing ownership errors THEN the system SHALL use proper borrowing patterns without unnecessary clones
2. WHEN resolving lifetime issues THEN the system SHALL ensure memory safety without performance degradation
3. WHEN fixing move errors THEN the system SHALL preserve the original logic while satisfying the borrow checker
4. WHEN resolving reference issues THEN the system SHALL use the most efficient borrowing strategy

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want missing imports and type errors resolved, so that all modules can access required functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing import errors THEN the system SHALL add only necessary imports without unused imports
2. WHEN resolving type mismatches THEN the system SHALL use appropriate type conversions or corrections
3. WHEN adding missing types THEN the system SHALL define types that match their intended usage
4. WHEN fixing serialization errors THEN the system SHALL use appropriate serde attributes or alternative approaches

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance monitoring and configuration errors resolved, so that the application can track system metrics effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing PerformanceMonitor errors THEN the system SHALL implement missing methods with appropriate functionality
2. WHEN resolving configuration issues THEN the system SHALL provide sensible defaults and proper validation
3. WHEN fixing serialization of system types THEN the system SHALL use custom serialization or alternative approaches
4. WHEN implementing monitoring features THEN the system SHALL maintain low overhead and accurate metrics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all warnings addressed appropriately, so that the codebase maintains high code quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing unused variable warnings THEN the system SHALL either use the variables or prefix with underscore appropriately
2. WHEN resolving unused import warnings THEN the system SHALL remove truly unused imports while keeping necessary ones
3. WHEN addressing mutability warnings THEN the system SHALL use the minimal required mutability
4. WHEN fixing other warnings THEN the system SHALL maintain code clarity and functionality
