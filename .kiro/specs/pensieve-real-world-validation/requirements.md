# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a **real-world validation system** that transforms pensieve from "works in theory" to "works in production." The core insight: most CLI tools fail not because of algorithmic issues, but because of edge cases, performance degradation, and poor user experience when faced with messy real-world data.

**The Problem**: Pensieve has been developed and tested with clean, controlled datasets. Real-world directories like `/home/amuldotexe/Desktop/RustRAW20250920` contain the chaos that breaks tools: weird file names, corrupted files, massive files, deep nesting, permission issues, and unexpected file types.

**The Solution**: A systematic validation framework that stress-tests pensieve against real-world complexity and provides actionable insights for improvement. This isn't just testing - it's product intelligence gathering.

**Success Metrics**: 
- Zero crashes on real-world data
- Clear user feedback for all edge cases  
- Performance predictability under load
- Actionable improvement roadmap

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Zero-Crash Reliability Validation

**User Story:** As a developer deploying pensieve in production, I need absolute confidence that it won't crash on messy real-world data, so that I can recommend it to other teams without reputation risk.

**The Insight**: Tools that crash lose user trust permanently. Better to skip files gracefully than crash spectacularly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pensieve processes `/home/amuldotexe/Desktop/RustRAW20250920` THEN it SHALL complete without any panics, crashes, or unhandled errors
2. WHEN encountering corrupted files, permission denied, or malformed content THEN pensieve SHALL log the issue and continue processing
3. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN pensieve SHALL degrade gracefully rather than crash
4. WHEN interrupted (Ctrl+C) THEN pensieve SHALL clean up resources and provide recovery instructions
5. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL report: total runtime, files processed, files skipped, error categories, and zero crashes
6. WHEN any crash occurs THEN it SHALL be treated as a critical bug requiring immediate investigation

### Requirement 2: Real-World File Chaos Handling

**User Story:** As a user with messy directories, I need pensieve to handle the weird files I actually have (not just the clean examples in docs), so that I can process my real data without manual cleanup.

**The Insight**: Real directories contain: files without extensions, files with wrong extensions, 0-byte files, gigantic files, files with emoji in names, files with spaces and special characters, symlinks, and files that claim to be one type but are actually another.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning `/home/amuldotexe/Desktop/RustRAW20250920` THEN pensieve SHALL create a "File Chaos Report" cataloging all unusual files found
2. WHEN encountering files without extensions THEN pensieve SHALL use content sniffing to determine type and report confidence level
3. WHEN finding files with misleading extensions (e.g., .txt that's actually binary) THEN pensieve SHALL detect the mismatch and handle appropriately
4. WHEN processing files with unusual names (unicode, spaces, special chars) THEN pensieve SHALL handle them without path errors
5. WHEN finding extremely large files (>100MB) THEN pensieve SHALL process them efficiently or skip with clear reasoning
6. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL report: file type accuracy, edge case handling success rate, and specific recommendations for improving file type detection

### Requirement 3: Deduplication ROI Validation

**User Story:** As a user with limited storage and processing budget, I need to know exactly how much time and space pensieve's deduplication saves me, so that I can justify using it over simpler alternatives.

**The Insight**: Deduplication is only valuable if the savings exceed the processing cost. Users need concrete ROI metrics, not just "found duplicates."

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing `/home/amuldotexe/Desktop/RustRAW20250920` THEN pensieve SHALL calculate and report exact storage savings in MB and percentage
2. WHEN deduplication completes THEN pensieve SHALL report time spent on deduplication vs. time saved in downstream processing
3. WHEN finding duplicate files THEN pensieve SHALL show duplicate groups with file paths and explain canonical selection logic
4. WHEN processing paragraphs THEN pensieve SHALL report token savings achieved through content deduplication
5. WHEN validation completes THEN pensieve SHALL provide a "Deduplication ROI Report" showing: storage saved, processing time saved, deduplication overhead, and net benefit
6. WHEN ROI is negative THEN pensieve SHALL recommend whether to disable deduplication for this dataset type

### Requirement 4: Performance Predictability Under Load

**User Story:** As a user processing large datasets, I need to know how long pensieve will take and whether it will slow down over time, so that I can plan my work and set realistic expectations.

**The Insight**: Users abandon tools that become unpredictably slow. Performance must be predictable and linear, or users need clear guidance on when to expect slowdowns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing `/home/amuldotexe/Desktop/RustRAW20250920` THEN pensieve SHALL maintain consistent processing speed (Â±20%) throughout the entire operation
2. WHEN database grows large THEN pensieve SHALL report if/when performance degrades and provide optimization suggestions
3. WHEN memory usage increases THEN pensieve SHALL report peak memory usage and warn if approaching system limits
4. WHEN processing different file types THEN pensieve SHALL report per-file-type processing speeds to help users predict future runs
5. WHEN validation completes THEN pensieve SHALL provide a "Performance Predictability Report" with: processing speed trends, memory usage patterns, and time estimates for similar datasets
6. WHEN performance degrades significantly THEN pensieve SHALL suggest specific optimizations (more RAM, SSD storage, etc.)

### Requirement 5: User Experience Reality Check

**User Story:** As a busy developer, I need pensieve to give me clear, actionable feedback about what it's doing and what I should do next, so that I can use it confidently without reading documentation every time.

**The Insight**: Great tools teach users how to use them through their output. Poor tools require constant documentation lookup and leave users guessing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pensieve starts processing THEN it SHALL show a clear progress indicator with ETA and current activity
2. WHEN errors occur THEN pensieve SHALL provide specific, actionable error messages (not just "failed to process file")
3. WHEN processing completes THEN pensieve SHALL provide a clear summary with next steps (how to query the database, what files to investigate)
4. WHEN interrupted THEN pensieve SHALL explain exactly how to resume and what state was preserved
5. WHEN validation completes THEN pensieve SHALL generate a "User Experience Report" highlighting confusing messages, missing feedback, and UX improvement opportunities
6. WHEN users would benefit from additional context THEN pensieve SHALL proactively provide it (e.g., "Found 500 duplicates - this is typical for code repositories")

### Requirement 6: Production Readiness Intelligence

**User Story:** As a team lead evaluating pensieve for production use, I need a comprehensive assessment of its readiness, limitations, and improvement roadmap, so that I can make an informed adoption decision.

**The Insight**: The goal isn't just to test pensieve - it's to generate actionable intelligence about whether it's ready for production and what needs to be fixed first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL generate a "Production Readiness Report" with clear recommendations: Ready/Not Ready/Ready with Caveats
2. WHEN issues are found THEN the system SHALL prioritize them by impact: Blocker/High/Medium/Low with specific user scenarios affected
3. WHEN performance is measured THEN the system SHALL provide scaling guidance: "Works well up to X files/GB, degrades beyond Y"
4. WHEN edge cases are discovered THEN the system SHALL provide reproduction steps and suggested fixes
5. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL export all findings in structured formats (JSON for automation, HTML for humans)
6. WHEN the report is generated THEN it SHALL include a specific improvement roadmap with estimated effort and impact for each issue

### Requirement 7: Reusable Validation Framework

**User Story:** As a developer working on similar CLI tools, I want to reuse this validation methodology for my own tools, so that I can achieve the same level of production confidence without reinventing the testing approach.

**The Insight**: The validation framework itself should be a reusable product that can be applied to other CLI tools, not just pensieve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the validation framework THEN it SHALL be tool-agnostic with clear interfaces for different CLI tools
2. WHEN configuring validation THEN it SHALL support different directory structures, file types, and performance expectations
3. WHEN running validation THEN it SHALL generate standardized reports that enable comparison across different tools and versions
4. WHEN validation framework is complete THEN it SHALL include comprehensive documentation and examples for other developers
5. WHEN framework is used on other tools THEN it SHALL require minimal modification to generate useful insights
6. WHEN validation methodology is documented THEN it SHALL include the reasoning behind each test and how to adapt it for different use cases
