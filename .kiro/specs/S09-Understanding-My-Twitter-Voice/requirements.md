I have written 60k tweets on twitter - maybe more

I want to analyze all of them with the prompt file : .kiro/steering/non-technical-authentic-voice-prompt.md

They are all placed at /Users/neetipatni/Desktop/Wisdom20250929/number-12-grimmauld-place/TwitterData01

the database : /Users/neetipatni/desktop/PensieveDB01

- Use code-ingest to ingest this into DB
- Use code-ingest to create tasks of 1000 line chunk size
