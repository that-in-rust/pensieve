# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Load your Twitter data into the database
  - Run code-ingest to put all your tweets into PostgreSQL
  - Check that the data loaded properly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [ ] 2. Create 1000-line chunks for voice analysis using code-ingest chunking engine
  - Use generate-hierarchical-tasks command with --chunks 1000 to create line-based chunks
  - Run: `./target/release/code-ingest generate-hierarchical-tasks INGEST_20250929133512 --chunks 1000 --output voice_analysis_tasks.md --db-path /Users/neetipatni/desktop/PensieveDB01`
  - This creates a new database table with 1000-line chunks optimized for voice analysis
  - Verify the new chunked table was created and contains proper line-based segments
  - Check that chunks preserve tweet boundaries and maintain coherent content blocks
  - Confirm chunk metadata includes line numbers, chunk counts, and original file references
  - _Requirements: 2.1_

- [ ] 3. Analyze each 1000-line chunk to understand your voice patterns
  - Apply the voice analysis prompt from the steering documents to each chunk
  - Use the chunked table created in Task 2 as the data source
  - For each chunk, extract:
    - Signature phrases and unique expressions
    - Sentence rhythm patterns and cadence preferences
    - Punctuation personality (dashes, ellipses, questions)
    - Metaphor families and recurring imagery
    - Emotional register patterns (vulnerable → philosophical → practical)
    - Philosophical themes and contrarian positions
    - Best individual tweets that capture voice at its purest
  - Store analysis results in a new table using code-ingest store-result functionality
  - Track which chunks contain the most authentic voice examples
  - Identify evolution patterns across chronological chunks
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 4. Create a readable summary of all insights
  - Gather all the voice analysis results
  - Write a comprehensive markdown report in the gringotts folder
  - Include your voice patterns, best tweets, and book creation framework
  - _Requirements: 2.6_
