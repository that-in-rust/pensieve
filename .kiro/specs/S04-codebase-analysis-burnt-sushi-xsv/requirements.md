# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables comprehensive analysis of the burnt-sushi/xsv codebase, a high-performance CSV command-line toolkit written in Rust. The analysis will focus on understanding the architecture, performance patterns, error handling strategies, and CLI design patterns that make xsv one of the most efficient CSV processing tools available. This analysis will serve as a reference implementation study for building high-performance command-line tools in Rust.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer studying Rust CLI tools, I want to analyze the xsv codebase architecture, so that I can understand how to build high-performance command-line applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the codebase analysis on xsv THEN the system SHALL extract and categorize all Rust modules, functions, and their relationships
2. WHEN analyzing the CLI structure THEN the system SHALL identify all subcommands, their arguments, and validation patterns
3. WHEN processing the codebase THEN the system SHALL complete analysis of the entire xsv repository (approximately 15,000 lines) in less than 10 seconds
4. IF the analysis encounters parsing errors THEN the system SHALL log specific file locations and continue processing remaining files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to identify performance optimization patterns in xsv, so that I can apply similar techniques in my own projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing performance-critical code THEN the system SHALL identify memory allocation patterns, zero-copy operations, and streaming implementations
2. WHEN examining CSV processing logic THEN the system SHALL extract buffer management strategies and I/O optimization techniques
3. WHEN processing benchmark code THEN the system SHALL identify performance test patterns and measurement methodologies
4. WHEN analyzing concurrent operations THEN the system SHALL document thread safety patterns and parallel processing strategies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a CLI tool designer, I want to understand xsv's command structure and error handling, so that I can design intuitive and robust command-line interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing CLI commands THEN the system SHALL extract all subcommand definitions, their parameters, and help text patterns
2. WHEN examining error handling THEN the system SHALL identify error types, propagation patterns, and user-facing error messages
3. WHEN processing configuration logic THEN the system SHALL document how xsv handles different input formats and output options
4. WHEN analyzing validation code THEN the system SHALL extract input validation patterns and constraint checking mechanisms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want to study xsv's use of external crates and dependency management, so that I can make informed decisions about crate selection for CSV processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN the system SHALL extract all external crates used, their versions, and usage patterns
2. WHEN examining CSV parsing logic THEN the system SHALL identify how xsv leverages the csv crate and any custom extensions
3. WHEN processing serialization code THEN the system SHALL document serde usage patterns and custom serialization implementations
4. WHEN analyzing testing infrastructure THEN the system SHALL extract testing patterns, mock strategies, and integration test approaches

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want to generate architectural insights from xsv's codebase, so that I can understand scalable design patterns for data processing tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating architectural analysis THEN the system SHALL produce module dependency graphs showing component relationships
2. WHEN analyzing data flow THEN the system SHALL trace how CSV data moves through the processing pipeline
3. WHEN examining abstraction layers THEN the system SHALL identify trait usage, generic programming patterns, and code reuse strategies
4. WHEN processing the complete analysis THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report with code metrics, complexity analysis, and architectural recommendations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a code reviewer, I want to export analysis results in multiple formats, so that I can share insights with different stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting analysis results THEN the system SHALL support JSON format for programmatic access
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL produce markdown format for documentation and review
3. WHEN creating visualizations THEN the system SHALL generate mermaid diagrams for architectural overviews
4. WHEN saving results THEN the system SHALL include metadata about analysis timestamp, xsv version analyzed, and analysis tool version
