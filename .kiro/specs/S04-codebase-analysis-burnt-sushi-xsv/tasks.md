# Implementation Plan

## Overview
Convert the S04 Knowledge Arbitrage design into systematic tasks for analyzing the burnt-sushi/xsv codebase using L1-L8 extraction methodology. Each task builds incrementally and focuses on extracting tactical implementations, strategic architecture, and foundational evolution insights.

# SPEC CLASSIFICATION : Analysis Spec
This is an analysis only Spec - we will be using tools and scripts but will not be making enhancements

## Database Configuration
- **Source Database**: `/Users/neetipatni/desktop/PensieveDB01`
- **Source Table**: `INGEST_20250928062949` (XSV codebase already ingested)
- **Results Table**: `QUERYRESULT_xsv_knowledge_arbitrage` (to be created)

## Task List

- [ ] 1. Verify XSV ingestion and database connectivity
  - Confirm connection to PensieveDB01 database
  - Verify INGEST_20250928062949 table exists with XSV codebase (59 files expected)
  - Validate data integrity and completeness of ingested XSV files
  - _Requirements: All requirements depend on valid source data_

- [ ] 2. Create results table schema for knowledge arbitrage analysis
  - Create QUERYRESULT_xsv_knowledge_arbitrage table with complete schema
  - Add indexes for efficient analysis queries (analysis_type, insight_category, transferability)
  - Create analysis_meta table for tracking execution metadata
  - Verify table creation and index performance
  - _Requirements: 5.4, 7.1-7.4, 8.4_

- [ ] 3. Implement L1-L3 tactical implementation extraction
  - Query INGEST_20250928062949 for all XSV Rust files
  - Extract L1 micro-optimizations (memory allocation, SIMD, zero-copy operations)
  - Extract L2 design patterns (abstraction boundaries, RAII variants, trait usage)
  - Identify L3 micro-library opportunities (components under 2000 LOC)
  - Store results in QUERYRESULT_xsv_knowledge_arbitrage with performance metrics
  - Validate <30 second execution time for entire XSV codebase
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 4. Implement L4-L6 strategic architecture analysis
  - Analyze L4 macro-library opportunities and ecosystem gaps
  - Document L5 low-level design decisions (concurrency models, state management)
  - Examine L6 domain-specific architecture (CSV processing pipelines, I/O optimization)
  - Generate actionable recommendations for Rust ecosystem improvements
  - Store strategic insights with architectural rationale in results table
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 5. Implement L7-L8 foundational evolution and intent archaeology
  - Identify L7 language limitations (borrow checker gaps, type system constraints)
  - Perform L8 intent archaeology using Git history analysis
  - Document historical constraints (hardware, team, deadline pressures)
  - Extract rejected alternatives and constraint-driven trade-offs
  - Generate recommendations for Rust language evolution
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 6. Implement triple-comparison analysis framework
  - Compare individual file content against module context (l1_window_content)
  - Compare individual files against system context (l2_window_content)  
  - Compare module patterns against system-wide architectural principles
  - Identify scaling patterns and cross-scale consistency
  - Store comparison insights showing pattern emergence across scales
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 7. Implement systematic chunked processing with expert council
  - Segment database content into 300-500 line chunks with 10-20 line overlap
  - Apply multi-persona analysis (Domain Expert, Strategic Analyst, Implementation Specialist, UX Advocate)
  - Execute mandatory Skeptical Engineer challenges for all primary assertions
  - Generate expert responses to challenges and synthesize refined insights
  - Create 5-10 fact-checkable verification questions per major insight
  - Track systematic processing progress across all chunks
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 8. Generate optimization arbitrage tasks and outputs
  - Create systematic tasks for extracting micro-optimizations and performance patterns
  - Generate cross-paradigm translation tasks (C, C++, Haskell, Erlang patterns)
  - Document unsafe usage patterns with safety invariants and alternatives
  - Format insights as structured Horcrux Codex training data with JSONB storage
  - Store all outputs in QUERYRESULT_xsv_knowledge_arbitrage table
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_

- [ ] 9. Generate visualization and export outputs
  - Query analysis results to create Mermaid flowcharts (module dependencies, data flow)
  - Generate performance visualization diagrams (optimization opportunities, bottlenecks)
  - Export analysis results using code-ingest print-to-md functionality
  - Create JSON exports for programmatic access and Horcrux Codex dataset
  - Generate comprehensive markdown reports with embedded visualizations
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3_

- [ ] 10. Complete metadata tracking and validation
  - Store complete analysis metadata (methodology, XSV version, commit hash, timestamp)
  - Record L1-L8 extraction completeness metrics and validation results
  - Document source database path and table references
  - Generate final quality assurance report with extraction statistics
  - Validate end-to-end pipeline from ingestion to knowledge arbitrage outputs
  - _Requirements: 8.4_

## Success Criteria
- All L1-L8 extraction levels completed with measurable insights
- Performance contract met: L1-L3 extraction completes in <30 seconds
- Triple-comparison analysis reveals cross-scale patterns
- Expert council validation challenges and refines all major insights
- Structured outputs ready for Horcrux Codex LLM training dataset
