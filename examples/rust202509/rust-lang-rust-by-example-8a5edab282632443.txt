# Rust By Example

[![Build Status](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example/actions/workflows/rbe.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example/actions)

Learn Rust with examples (Live code editor included)

## Using

If you'd like to read Rust by Example, you can visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/>
to read it online.

If you'd like to read it locally, [install Rust], and then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example
cd rust-by-example
cargo install mdbook
mdbook build
mdbook serve
```

[install Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

To be able to run the examples, you must be connected to the internet; you can
read all content offline, however!

**The following warnings can be ignored safely.**

```text
[WARN] (mdbook::preprocess::cmd): The command wasn't found, is the "gettext" preprocessor installed?
[WARN] (mdbook::preprocess::cmd):   Command: mdbook-gettext
```

### Using translated version

If there is a translated resource in `po/` directory, it can be specified through `MDBOOK_BOOK__LANGUAGE` like below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example
cd rust-by-example
cargo install mdbook
MDBOOK_BOOK__LANGUAGE=ja mdbook build
MDBOOK_BOOK__LANGUAGE=ja mdbook serve
```

================================================
FILE: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
================================================
# The Rust Code of Conduct

A version of this document [can be found online](https://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html).

## Conduct

**Contact**: [rust-mods@rust-lang.org](mailto:rust-mods@rust-lang.org)

* We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.
* On IRC, please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
* Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/); if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
* Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact one of the channel ops or any of the [Rust moderation team][mod_team] immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.
* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct. If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the [Rust moderation team][mod_team].

1. Remarks that violate the Rust standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.)
2. Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.
3. Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
4. If the warning is unheeded, the user will be "kicked," i.e., kicked out of the communication channel to cool off.
5. If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.
6. Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
7. If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, **in private**. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.
8. Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.

In the Rust community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don't just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they're off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.

And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could've communicated better — remember that it's your responsibility to make your fellow Rustaceans comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.

The enforcement policies listed above apply to all official Rust venues; including official IRC channels (#rust, #rust-internals, #rust-tools, #rust-libs, #rustc, #rust-beginners, #rust-docs, #rust-community, #rust-lang, and #cargo); GitHub repositories under rust-lang, rust-lang-nursery, and rust-lang-deprecated; and all forums under rust-lang.org (users.rust-lang.org, internals.rust-lang.org). For other projects adopting the Rust Code of Conduct, please contact the maintainers of those projects for enforcement. If you wish to use this code of conduct for your own project, consider explicitly mentioning your moderation policy or making a copy with your own moderation policy so as to avoid confusion.

*Adapted from the [Node.js Policy on Trolling](http://blog.izs.me/post/30036893703/policy-on-trolling) as well as the [Contributor Covenant v1.3.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/).*

# Rust by Example contribution guidelines

Thank you for your interest in making Rust by Example (also known as RBE)
better! We'd love to have your contribution. We expect all contributors to
abide by the [Rust code of conduct], which you can find at that link or in the
[`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`] file in this repository.

[Rust code of conduct]: https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct
[`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

## License

RBE is dual licensed under the MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses, and so are all
contributions. Please see the [`LICENSE-MIT`] and [`LICENSE-APACHE`] files in
this directory for more details.

[`LICENSE-MIT`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT
[`LICENSE-APACHE`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example/blob/master/LICENSE-APACHE

## Pull Requests

To make changes to RBE, please send in pull requests on GitHub to the `master`
branch. We'll review them and either merge or request changes. Travis CI tests
everything as well, so you may get feedback from it too.

If you make additions or other changes to a pull request, feel free to either amend
previous commits or only add new ones, however you prefer. We may ask you to squash
your commits before merging, depending.

## Issue Tracker

You can find the issue tracker [on
GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example/issues). If you've found a
problem with RBE, please open an issue there.

We use the following labels:

* `enhancement`: This is for any request for new sections or functionality.
* `bug`: This is for anything that's in RBE, but incorrect or not working.
* `discussion`: A discussion about improving something in RBE; this may lead to new
  enhancement or bug issues.
* `E-mentor`: This issue has someone dedicated to helping a new contributor fix it!
  Can apply to both enhancement or bug issues.

## Development workflow

To build RBE, [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), and then:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example
$ cd rust-by-example
$ cargo install mdbook
$ mdbook build
```

**The following warnings can be ignored safely.**

```text
[WARN] (mdbook::preprocess::cmd): The command wasn't found, is the "gettext" preprocessor installed?
[WARN] (mdbook::preprocess::cmd):   Command: mdbook-gettext
```

[install Rust]: http://rust-lang.org/install.html

The files will be in the `book` directory at the top-level; `mdbook serve` will
open the contents in your web browser ([localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default).

To run the tests:

```bash
$ mdbook test
```

If you're adding a new chapter, you'll need to edit `src\SUMMARY.md` to add it. If
you're tweaking an existing example, you'll need to edit the corresponding file; check
`src\SUMMARY.md` to see a mapping of where chapters go to files.

   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Rust by Example translation guidelines

Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md] file for general contribution guidelines.
This file describes about the translation workflow.

[CONTRIBUTING.md]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

## Translation workflow

### Preparation

RBE uses [mdbook-i18n-helpers](https://github.com/google/mdbook-i18n-helpers) as a translation framework.
The following tools are required.

* GNU gettext utilities ( `msgmerge` and `msgcat` )
* mdbook-i18n-helpers ( `cargo install mdbook-i18n-helpers` )

### Creating and Updating Translations

Please see the [mdbook-i18n-helpers USAGE](https://github.com/google/mdbook-i18n-helpers/blob/main/i18n-helpers/USAGE.md) file for the detailed usage of mdbook-i18n-helpers.
The summarized command list is below:

#### Generating a message template

The generated message templete `po/messages.pot` is required to create or update translations.

```bash
MDBOOK_OUTPUT='{"xgettext": {"pot-file": "messages.pot"}}' \
  mdbook build -d po
```

#### Creating a new translation resource

`xx` is [ISO 639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) language code.

```bash
msginit -i po/messages.pot -l xx -o po/xx.po
```

#### Updating the existing translation resource

```bash
msgmerge --update po/xx.po po/messages.pot
```

#### Tracking translation progress

```bash
msgfmt --statistics po/xx.po
```

### Editing translation resources

After generating a translation resource `po/xx.po`, you can write translation messages in `msgstr` entry of `po/xx.po`.
To build a translated book, the following command can be used.

```bash
MDBOOK_BOOK__LANGUAGE=xx mdbook build
MDBOOK_BOOK__LANGUAGE=xx mdbook serve
```

### Add a language entry

Please add a language entry in `.github/workflows/rbe.yml`, `theme/index.hbs`, and `src/bootstrap/src/core/build_steps/doc.rs` in [rust-lang/rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) like below:

* `rbe.yml`

```yml
env:
  # Update the language picker in index.hbs to link new languages.
  LANGUAGES: xx yy zz
```

* `index.hbs`

```html
<ul id="language-list" class="theme-popup" aria-label="Languages" role="menu">
  <li role="none"><button role="menuitem" class="theme">
      <a id="en">English</a>
  </button></li>
  <li role="none"><button role="menuitem" class="theme">
      <a id="xx">XX language</a>
  </button></li>
  <li role="none"><button role="menuitem" class="theme">
      <a id="yy">YY language</a>
  </button></li>
  <li role="none"><button role="menuitem" class="theme">
      <a id="zz">ZZ language</a>
  </button></li>
</ul>
```

* `src/bootstrap/src/core/build_steps/doc.rs` in [rust-lang/rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)

```rust
RustByExample, "src/doc/rust-by-example", "rust-by-example", &["xx", "yy", "zz"], submodule;
```

# Rust by Example 日本語版 翻訳ガイド

日本語版の翻訳は https://github.com/rust-lang-ja/rust-by-example にて日本語のレビューを行います。
翻訳に貢献される方は以下のフローに従ってください。

* https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example を自身のアカウントにフォークする
* `po/ja.po` に訳文を追加・変更する
* https://github.com/rust-lang-ja/rust-by-example （の`ja`ブランチ）にプルリクエストを出す
  + 直接オリジナルのリポジトリに出しても訳文自体のレビューができないので rust-lang-ja で一旦レビューします
  + 上記リポジトリは`ja`ブランチがデフォルトなので通常通りプルリクエストを作成すれば`ja`ブランチ向けになります

rust-lang-ja のレビュワーは以下のように作業します。

* プルリクエストをレビューし、問題なければ`ja`ブランチにマージ
* https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example にプルリクエストを出す

最終的に https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example でマージされれば公開されます。

## 翻訳の方法

### 全般的なこと

* 文体は「です・ます」調
* 記号類は原則として全角（括弧`（）`やコロン`：`など）

### 対訳表

* カタカナ語のままで違和感のない用語はカタカナ語のまま使う
  + 気持としては「無理矢理和訳」を避けたい。そのための基準。
  + カタカナ語の方が用語として認識しやすい
* カタカナ語の末尾の長音記号「ー」は省く(JIS規格)
* 構文キーワードなどはそのままアルファベットを使う

# Attributes

An attribute is metadata applied to some module, crate or item. This metadata
can be used to/for:

<!-- TODO: Link these to their respective examples -->

* [conditional compilation of code][cfg]
* [set crate name, version and type (binary or library)][crate]
* disable [lints][lint] (warnings)
* enable compiler features (macros, glob imports, etc.)
* link to a foreign library
* mark functions as unit tests
* mark functions that will be part of a benchmark
* [attribute like macros][macros]

Attributes look like `#[outer_attribute]` or `#![inner_attribute]`,
with the difference between them being where they apply.

* `#[outer_attribute]` applies to the [item][item] immediately
  following it. Some examples of items are: a function, a module
  declaration, a constant, a structure, an enum. Here is an example
  where attribute `#[derive(Debug)]` applies to the struct
  `Rectangle`:

  ```rust
  #[derive(Debug)]
  struct Rectangle {
      width: u32,
      height: u32,
  }
  ```

* `#![inner_attribute]` applies to the enclosing [item][item] (typically a
  module or a crate). In other words, this attribute is interpreted as
  applying to the entire scope in which it's placed. Here is an example
  where `#![allow(unused_variables)]` applies to the whole crate (if
  placed in `main.rs`):

  ```rust
  #![allow(unused_variables)]

  fn main() {
      let x = 3; // This would normally warn about an unused variable.
  }
  ```

Attributes can take arguments with different syntaxes:

* `#[attribute = "value"]`
* `#[attribute(key = "value")]`
* `#[attribute(value)]`

Attributes can have multiple values and can be separated over multiple lines, too:

```rust,ignore
#[attribute(value, value2)]


#[attribute(value, value2, value3,
            value4, value5)]
```

# Cargo

`cargo` is the official Rust package management tool. It has lots of really
useful features to improve code quality and developer velocity! These include

- Dependency management and integration with [crates.io](https://crates.io) (the
  official Rust package registry)
- Awareness of unit tests
- Awareness of benchmarks

This chapter will go through some quick basics, but you can find the
comprehensive docs in [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).

# Compatibility

The Rust language is evolving rapidly, and because of this certain compatibility

possible.

================================================
FILE: src/conversion.md
================================================
# Conversion

Primitive types can be converted to each other through [casting].

Rust addresses conversion between custom types (i.e., `struct` and `enum`)
by the use of [traits]. The generic
conversions will use the [`From`] and [`Into`] traits. However there are more
specific ones for the more common cases, in particular when converting to and
from `String`s.

[casting]: types/cast.md
[traits]: trait.md

================================================
FILE: src/crates.md
================================================
# Crates

A crate is a compilation unit in Rust. Whenever `rustc some_file.rs` is called,
`some_file.rs` is treated as the *crate file*. If `some_file.rs` has `mod`
declarations in it, then the contents of the module files would be inserted in
places where `mod` declarations in the crate file are found, *before* running
the compiler over it. In other words, modules do *not* get compiled
individually, only crates get compiled.

A crate can be compiled into a binary or into a library. By default, `rustc`
will produce a binary from a crate. This behavior can be overridden by passing
the `--crate-type` flag to `lib`.



================================================
FILE: src/custom_types.md
================================================
# Custom Types

Rust custom data types are formed mainly through the two keywords:

* `struct`: define a structure
* `enum`: define an enumeration

Constants can also be created via the `const` and `static` keywords.



================================================
FILE: src/error.md
================================================
# Error handling

Error handling is the process of handling the possibility of failure. For
example, failing to read a file and then continuing to use that *bad* input
would clearly be problematic. Noticing and explicitly managing those errors
saves the rest of the program from various pitfalls.

There are various ways to deal with errors in Rust, which are described in the
following subchapters. They all have more or less subtle differences and different
use cases. As a rule of thumb:

An explicit `panic` is mainly useful for tests and dealing with unrecoverable errors.
For prototyping it can be useful, for example when dealing with functions that
haven't been implemented yet, but in those cases the more descriptive `unimplemented`
is better. In tests `panic` is a reasonable way to explicitly fail.

The `Option` type is for when a value is optional or when the lack of a value is
not an error condition. For example the parent of a directory - `/` and `C:` don't
have one. When dealing with `Option`s, `unwrap` is fine for prototyping and cases
where it's absolutely certain that there is guaranteed to be a value. However `expect`
is more useful since it lets you specify an error message in case something goes
wrong anyway.

When there is a chance that things do go wrong and the caller has to deal with the
problem, use `Result`. You can `unwrap` and `expect` them as well (please don't
do that unless it's a test or quick prototype).

For a more rigorous discussion of error handling, refer to the error
handling section in the [official book][book].

================================================
FILE: src/expression.md
================================================
# Expressions

A Rust program is (mostly) made up of a series of statements:

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    // statement
    // statement
    // statement
}
```

There are a few kinds of statements in Rust. The most common two are declaring
a variable binding, and using a `;` with an expression:

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    // variable binding
    let x = 5;

    // expression;
    x;
    x + 1;
    15;
}
```

Blocks are expressions too, so they can be used as values in
assignments. The last expression in the block will be assigned to the
place expression such as a local variable. However, if the last expression of the block ends with a
semicolon, the return value will be `()`.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let x = 5u32;

    let y = {
        let x_squared = x * x;
        let x_cube = x_squared * x;

        // This expression will be assigned to `y`
        x_cube + x_squared + x
    };

    let z = {
        // The semicolon suppresses this expression and `()` is assigned to `z`
        2 * x;
    };

    println!("x is {:?}", x);
    println!("y is {:?}", y);
    println!("z is {:?}", z);
}
```



================================================
FILE: src/flow_control.md
================================================
# Flow of Control

An integral part of any programming language are ways to modify control flow:
`if`/`else`, `for`, and others. Let's talk about them in Rust.



================================================
FILE: src/fn.md
================================================
# Functions

Functions are declared using the `fn` keyword. Its arguments are type
annotated, just like variables, and, if the function returns a value, the
return type must be specified after an arrow `->`.

The final expression in the function will be used as return value.
Alternatively, the `return` statement can be used to return a value earlier
from within the function, even from inside loops or `if` statements.

Let's rewrite FizzBuzz using functions!

```rust,editable
// Unlike C/C++, there's no restriction on the order of function definitions
fn main() {
    // We can use this function here, and define it somewhere later
    fizzbuzz_to(100);
}

// Function that returns a boolean value
fn is_divisible_by(lhs: u32, rhs: u32) -> bool {
    // Corner case, early return
    if rhs == 0 {
        return false;
    }

    // This is an expression, the `return` keyword is not necessary here
    lhs % rhs == 0
}

// Functions that "don't" return a value, actually return the unit type `()`
fn fizzbuzz(n: u32) -> () {
    if is_divisible_by(n, 15) {
        println!("fizzbuzz");
    } else if is_divisible_by(n, 3) {
        println!("fizz");
    } else if is_divisible_by(n, 5) {
        println!("buzz");
    } else {
        println!("{}", n);
    }
}

// When a function returns `()`, the return type can be omitted from the
// signature
fn fizzbuzz_to(n: u32) {
    for n in 1..=n {
        fizzbuzz(n);
    }
}
```



================================================
FILE: src/generics.md
================================================
# Generics

*Generics* is the topic of generalizing types and functionalities to broader
cases. This is extremely useful for reducing code duplication in many ways,
but can call for rather involved syntax. Namely, being generic requires
taking great care to specify over which types a generic type
is actually considered valid. The simplest and most common use of generics
is for type parameters.

A type parameter is specified as generic by the use of angle brackets and upper
[camel case][camelcase]: `<Aaa, Bbb, ...>`. "Generic type parameters" are
typically represented as `<T>`. In Rust, "generic" also describes anything that
accepts one or more generic type parameters `<T>`. Any type specified as a
generic type parameter is generic, and everything else is concrete (non-generic).

For example, defining a *generic function* named `foo` that takes an argument
`T` of any type:

```rust,ignore
fn foo<T>(arg: T) { ... }
```

Because `T` has been specified as a generic type parameter using `<T>`, it
is considered generic when used here as `(arg: T)`. This is the case even if `T`
has previously been defined as a `struct`.

This example shows some of the syntax in action:

```rust,editable
// A concrete type `A`.
struct A;

// In defining the type `Single`, the first use of `A` is not preceded by `<A>`.
// Therefore, `Single` is a concrete type, and `A` is defined as above.
struct Single(A);
//            ^ Here is `Single`s first use of the type `A`.

// Here, `<T>` precedes the first use of `T`, so `SingleGen` is a generic type.
// Because the type parameter `T` is generic, it could be anything, including
// the concrete type `A` defined at the top.
struct SingleGen<T>(T);

fn main() {
    // `Single` is concrete and explicitly takes `A`.
    let _s = Single(A);

    // Create a variable `_char` of type `SingleGen<char>`
    // and give it the value `SingleGen('a')`.
    // Here, `SingleGen` has a type parameter explicitly specified.
    let _char: SingleGen<char> = SingleGen('a');

    // `SingleGen` can also have a type parameter implicitly specified:
    let _t    = SingleGen(A); // Uses `A` defined at the top.
    let _i32  = SingleGen(6); // Uses `i32`.
    let _char = SingleGen('a'); // Uses `char`.
}
```

FILE: src/hello.md
================================================
# Hello World

This is the source code of the traditional Hello World program.

```rust,editable
// This is a comment, and is ignored by the compiler.
// You can test this code by clicking the "Run" button over there ->
// or if you prefer to use your keyboard, you can use the "Ctrl + Enter"
// shortcut.

// This code is editable, feel free to hack it!
// You can always return to the original code by clicking the "Reset" button ->

// This is the main function.
fn main() {
    // Statements here are executed when the compiled binary is called.

    // Print text to the console.
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

`println!` is a [*macro*][macros] that prints text to the
console.

A binary can be generated using the Rust compiler: `rustc`.

```bash
$ rustc hello.rs
```

`rustc` will produce a `hello` binary that can be executed.

```bash
$ ./hello
Hello World!
```

### Activity

Click 'Run' above to see the expected output. Next, add a new
line with a second `println!` macro so that the output shows:

```text
Hello World!
I'm a Rustacean!
```

Rust provides a powerful macro system that allows metaprogramming. As you've
seen in previous chapters, macros look like functions, except that their name
ends with a bang `!`, but instead of generating a function call, macros are
expanded into source code that gets compiled with the rest of the program.
However, unlike macros in C and other languages, Rust macros are expanded into
abstract syntax trees, rather than string preprocessing, so you don't get
unexpected precedence bugs.

Macros are created using the `macro_rules!` macro.

```rust,editable
// This is a simple macro named `say_hello`.
macro_rules! say_hello {
    // `()` indicates that the macro takes no argument.
    () => {
        // The macro will expand into the contents of this block.
        println!("Hello!")
    };
}

fn main() {
    // This call will expand into `println!("Hello!")`
    say_hello!()
}
```

So why are macros useful?

1. Don't repeat yourself. There are many cases where you may need similar
   functionality in multiple places but with different types. Often, writing a
   macro is a useful way to avoid repeating code. (More on this later)

2. Domain-specific languages. Macros allow you to define special syntax for a
   specific purpose. (More on this later)

3. Variadic interfaces. Sometimes you want to define an interface that takes a
   variable number of arguments. An example is `println!` which could take any
   number of arguments, depending on the format string. (More on this later)

# Modules

Rust provides a powerful module system that can be used to hierarchically split
code in logical units (modules), and manage visibility (public/private) between
them.

A module is a collection of items: functions, structs, traits, `impl` blocks,
and even other modules.



================================================
FILE: src/primitives.md
================================================
# Primitives

Rust provides access to a wide variety of `primitives`. A sample includes:

### Scalar Types

* Signed integers: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128` and `isize` (pointer size)
* Unsigned integers: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128` and `usize` (pointer
  size)
* Floating point: `f32`, `f64`
* `char` Unicode scalar values like `'a'`, `'α'` and `'∞'` (4 bytes each)
* `bool` either `true` or `false`
* The unit type `()`, whose only possible value is an empty tuple: `()`

Despite the value of a unit type being a tuple, it is not considered a compound
type because it does not contain multiple values.

### Compound Types

* Arrays like `[1, 2, 3]`
* Tuples like `(1, true)`

Variables can always be *type annotated*. Numbers may additionally be annotated
via a *suffix* or *by default*. Integers default to `i32` and floats to `f64`.
Note that Rust can also infer types from context.

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
fn main() {
    // Variables can be type annotated.
    let logical: bool = true;

    let a_float: f64 = 1.0;  // Regular annotation
    let an_integer   = 5i32; // Suffix annotation

    // Or a default will be used.
    let default_float   = 3.0; // `f64`
    let default_integer = 7;   // `i32`

    // A type can also be inferred from context.
    let mut inferred_type = 12; // Type i64 is inferred from another line.
    inferred_type = 4294967296i64;

    // A mutable variable's value can be changed.
    let mut mutable = 12; // Mutable `i32`
    mutable = 21;

    // Error! The type of a variable can't be changed.
    mutable = true;

    // Variables can be overwritten with shadowing.
    let mutable = true;

    /* Compound types - Array and Tuple */

    // Array signature consists of Type T and length as [T; length].
    let my_array: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Tuple is a collection of values of different types
    // and is constructed using parentheses ().
    let my_tuple = (5u32, 1u8, true, -5.04f32);
}
```

# Scoping rules

Scopes play an important part in ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
That is, they indicate to the compiler when borrows are valid, when
resources can be freed, and when variables are created or destroyed.

# Std library types

The `std` library provides many custom types which expands drastically on
the `primitives`. Some of these include:

* growable `String`s like: `"hello world"`
* growable vectors: `[1, 2, 3]`
* optional types: `Option<i32>`
* error handling types: `Result<i32, i32>`
* heap allocated pointers: `Box<i32>`

Many other types are provided by the std library to support
things such as:

# Testing

Rust is a programming language that cares a lot about correctness and it
includes support for writing software tests within the language itself.

Testing comes in three styles:

* [Unit][unit] testing.
* [Doc][doc] testing.
* [Integration][integration] testing.

Also Rust has support for specifying additional dependencies for tests:

* [Dev-dependencies][dev-dependencies]

================================================
# Traits

A `trait` is a collection of methods defined for an unknown type:
`Self`. They can access other methods declared in the same trait.

Traits can be implemented for any data type. In the example below,
we define `Animal`, a group of methods. The `Animal` `trait` is
then implemented for the `Sheep` data type, allowing the use of
methods from `Animal` with a `Sheep`.

```rust,editable
struct Sheep { naked: bool, name: &'static str }

trait Animal {
    // Associated function signature; `Self` refers to the implementor type.
    fn new(name: &'static str) -> Self;

    // Method signatures; these will return a string.
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;
    fn noise(&self) -> &'static str;

    // Traits can provide default method definitions.
    fn talk(&self) {
        println!("{} says {}", self.name(), self.noise());
    }
}

impl Sheep {
    fn is_naked(&self) -> bool {
        self.naked
    }

    fn shear(&mut self) {
        if self.is_naked() {
            // Implementor methods can use the implementor's trait methods.
            println!("{} is already naked...", self.name());
        } else {
            println!("{} gets a haircut!", self.name);

            self.naked = true;
        }
    }
}

// Implement the `Animal` trait for `Sheep`.
impl Animal for Sheep {
    // `Self` is the implementor type: `Sheep`.
    fn new(name: &'static str) -> Sheep {
        Sheep { name: name, naked: false }
    }

    fn name(&self) -> &'static str {
        self.name
    }

    fn noise(&self) -> &'static str {
        if self.is_naked() {
            "baaaaah?"
        } else {
            "baaaaah!"
        }
    }

    // Default trait methods can be overridden.
    fn talk(&self) {
        // For example, we can add some quiet contemplation.
        println!("{} pauses briefly... {}", self.name, self.noise());
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Type annotation is necessary in this case.
    let mut dolly: Sheep = Animal::new("Dolly");
    // TODO ^ Try removing the type annotations.

    dolly.talk();
    dolly.shear();
    dolly.talk();
}
```

# Types

Rust provides several mechanisms to change or define the type of primitive and
user defined types. The following sections cover:

* [Casting] between primitive types
* Specifying the desired type of [literals]
* Using [type inference]
* [Aliasing] types

[Casting]: types/cast.md
[literals]: types/literals.md
[type inference]: types/inference.md

================================================
# Unsafe Operations

As an introduction to this section, to borrow from [the official docs][unsafe],
"one should try to minimize the amount of unsafe code in a code base." With that
in mind, let's get started! Unsafe annotations in Rust are used to bypass
protections put in place by the compiler; specifically, there are four primary
things that unsafe is used for:

* dereferencing raw pointers
* calling functions or methods which are `unsafe` (including calling a function
  over FFI, see [a previous chapter](std_misc/ffi.md) of the book)
* accessing or modifying static mutable variables
* implementing unsafe traits

### Raw Pointers

Raw pointers `*` and references `&T` function similarly, but references are
always safe because they are guaranteed to point to valid data due to the
borrow checker. Dereferencing a raw pointer can only be done through an unsafe
block.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let raw_p: *const u32 = &10;

    unsafe {
        assert!(*raw_p == 10);
    }
}
```

### Calling Unsafe Functions

Some functions can be declared as `unsafe`, meaning it is the programmer's
responsibility to ensure correctness instead of the compiler's. One example
of this is [`std::slice::from_raw_parts`] which will create a slice given a
pointer to the first element and a length.

```rust,editable
use std::slice;

fn main() {
    let some_vector = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];

    let pointer = some_vector.as_ptr();
    let length = some_vector.len();

    unsafe {
        let my_slice: &[u32] = slice::from_raw_parts(pointer, length);

        assert_eq!(some_vector.as_slice(), my_slice);
    }
}
```

For `slice::from_raw_parts`, one of the assumptions which *must* be upheld is
that the pointer passed in points to valid memory and that the memory pointed to
is of the correct type. If these invariants aren't upheld then the program's
behaviour is undefined and there is no knowing what will happen.

[unsafe]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html
[`std::slice::from_raw_parts`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/slice/fn.from_raw_parts.html



================================================
FILE: src/variable_bindings.md
================================================
# Variable Bindings

Rust provides type safety via static typing. Variable bindings can be type
annotated when declared. However, in most cases, the compiler will be able
to infer the type of the variable from the context, heavily reducing the
annotation burden.

Values (like literals) can be bound to variables, using the `let` binding.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let an_integer = 1u32;
    let a_boolean = true;
    let unit = ();

    // copy `an_integer` into `copied_integer`
    let copied_integer = an_integer;

    println!("An integer: {:?}", copied_integer);
    println!("A boolean: {:?}", a_boolean);
    println!("Meet the unit value: {:?}", unit);

    // The compiler warns about unused variable bindings; these warnings can
    // be silenced by prefixing the variable name with an underscore
    let _unused_variable = 3u32;

    let noisy_unused_variable = 2u32;
    // FIXME ^ Prefix with an underscore to suppress the warning
    // Please note that warnings may not be shown in a browser
}
```



================================================
FILE: src/attribute/cfg.md
================================================
# `cfg`

Configuration conditional checks are possible through two different operators:

* the `cfg` attribute: `#[cfg(...)]` in attribute position
* the `cfg!` macro: `cfg!(...)` in boolean expressions

While the former enables conditional compilation, the latter conditionally
evaluates to `true` or `false` literals allowing for checks at run-time. Both
utilize identical argument syntax.

`cfg!`, unlike `#[cfg]`, does not remove any code and only evaluates to true or false. For example, all blocks in an if/else expression need to be valid when `cfg!` is used for the condition, regardless of what `cfg!` is evaluating.

```rust,editable
// This function only gets compiled if the target OS is linux
#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]
fn are_you_on_linux() {
    println!("You are running linux!");
}

// And this function only gets compiled if the target OS is *not* linux
#[cfg(not(target_os = "linux"))]
fn are_you_on_linux() {
    println!("You are *not* running linux!");
}

fn main() {
    are_you_on_linux();

    println!("Are you sure?");
    if cfg!(target_os = "linux") {
        println!("Yes. It's definitely linux!");
    } else {
        println!("Yes. It's definitely *not* linux!");
    }
}
```

FILE: src/attribute/crate.md
================================================
# Crates

The `crate_type` attribute can be used to tell the compiler whether a crate is
a binary or a library (and even which type of library), and the `crate_name`
attribute can be used to set the name of the crate.

However, it is important to note that both the `crate_type` and `crate_name`
attributes have **no** effect whatsoever when using Cargo, the Rust package
manager. Since Cargo is used for the majority of Rust projects, this means
real-world uses of `crate_type` and `crate_name` are relatively limited.

```rust,editable
// This crate is a library
#![crate_type = "lib"]
// The library is named "rary"
#![crate_name = "rary"]

pub fn public_function() {
    println!("called rary's `public_function()`");
}

fn private_function() {
    println!("called rary's `private_function()`");
}

pub fn indirect_access() {
    print!("called rary's `indirect_access()`, that\n> ");

    private_function();
}
```

When the `crate_type` attribute is used, we no longer need to pass the
`--crate-type` flag to `rustc`.

```shell
$ rustc lib.rs
$ ls lib*
library.rlib
```



================================================
FILE: src/attribute/unused.md
================================================
# `dead_code`

The compiler provides a `dead_code`
[*lint*][lint] that will warn
about unused functions. An *attribute* can be used to disable the lint.

```rust,editable
fn used_function() {}

// `#[allow(dead_code)]` is an attribute that disables the `dead_code` lint
#[allow(dead_code)]
fn unused_function() {}

fn noisy_unused_function() {}
// FIXME ^ Add an attribute to suppress the warning

fn main() {
    used_function();
}
```

Note that in real programs, you should eliminate dead code. In these examples
we'll allow dead code in some places because of the interactive nature of the
examples.

FILE: src/attribute/cfg/custom.md
================================================
# Custom

Some conditionals like `target_os` are implicitly provided by `rustc`, but
custom conditionals must be passed to `rustc` using the `--cfg` flag.

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
#[cfg(some_condition)]
fn conditional_function() {
    println!("condition met!");
}

fn main() {
    conditional_function();
}
```

Try to run this to see what happens without the custom `cfg` flag.

With the custom `cfg` flag:

```shell
$ rustc --cfg some_condition custom.rs && ./custom
condition met!
```



================================================
FILE: src/cargo/build_scripts.md
================================================
# Build Scripts

Sometimes a normal build from `cargo` is not enough. Perhaps your crate needs
some pre-requisites before `cargo` will successfully compile, things like code
generation, or some native code that needs to be compiled. To solve this problem
we have build scripts that Cargo can run.

To add a build script to your package it can either be specified in the
`Cargo.toml` as follows:

```toml
[package]
...
build = "build.rs"
```

Otherwise Cargo will look for a `build.rs` file in the project directory by
default.

## How to use a build script

The build script is simply another Rust file that will be compiled and invoked
prior to compiling anything else in the package. Hence it can be used to fulfill
pre-requisites of your crate.

Cargo provides the script with inputs via environment variables [specified
here] that can be used.

The script provides output via stdout. All lines printed are written to
`target/debug/build/<pkg>/output`. Further, lines prefixed with `cargo:` will be
interpreted by Cargo directly and hence can be used to define parameters for the
package's compilation.

For further specification and examples have a read of the
[Cargo specification][cargo_specification].

================================================
FILE: src/cargo/conventions.md
================================================
# Conventions

In the previous chapter, we saw the following directory hierarchy:

```txt
foo
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── main.rs
```

Suppose that we wanted to have two binaries in the same project, though. What
then?

It turns out that `cargo` supports this. The default binary name is `main`, as
we saw before, but you can add additional binaries by placing them in a `bin/`
directory:

```txt
foo
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    ├── main.rs
    └── bin
        └── my_other_bin.rs
```

To tell `cargo` to only compile or run this binary, we just pass `cargo` the
`--bin my_other_bin` flag, where `my_other_bin` is the name of the binary we
want to work with.

In addition to extra binaries, `cargo` supports [more features] such as
benchmarks, tests, and examples.

In the next chapter, we will look more closely at tests.

[more features]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html



================================================
FILE: src/cargo/deps.md
================================================
# Dependencies

Most programs have dependencies on some libraries. If you have ever managed
dependencies by hand, you know how much of a pain this can be. Luckily, the Rust
ecosystem comes standard with `cargo`! `cargo` can manage dependencies for a
project.

To create a new Rust project,

```sh
# A binary
cargo new foo

# A library
cargo new --lib bar
```

For the rest of this chapter, let's assume we are making a binary, rather than
a library, but all of the concepts are the same.

After the above commands, you should see a file hierarchy like this:

```txt
.
├── bar
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── lib.rs
└── foo
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
        └── main.rs
```

The `main.rs` is the root source file for your new `foo` project -- nothing new there.
The `Cargo.toml` is the config file for `cargo` for this project. If you
look inside it, you should see something like this:

```toml
[package]
name = "foo"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["mark"]

[dependencies]
```

The `name` field under `[package]` determines the name of the project. This is
used by `crates.io` if you publish the crate (more later). It is also the name
of the output binary when you compile.

The `version` field is a crate version number using [Semantic
Versioning](http://semver.org/).

The `authors` field is a list of authors used when publishing the crate.

The `[dependencies]` section lets you add dependencies for your project.

For example, suppose that we want our program to have a great CLI. You can find
lots of great packages on [crates.io](https://crates.io) (the official Rust
package registry). One popular choice is [clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap).
As of this writing, the most recent published version of `clap` is `2.27.1`. To
add a dependency to our program, we can simply add the following to our
`Cargo.toml` under `[dependencies]`: `clap = "2.27.1"`. And that's it! You can start using
`clap` in your program.

`cargo` also supports [other types of dependencies][dependencies]. Here is just
a small sampling:

```toml
[package]
name = "foo"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["mark"]

[dependencies]
clap = "2.27.1" # from crates.io
rand = { git = "https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand" } # from online repo
bar = { path = "../bar" } # from a path in the local filesystem
```

`cargo` is more than a dependency manager. All of the available
configuration options are listed in the [format specification][manifest] of
`Cargo.toml`.

To build our project we can execute `cargo build` anywhere in the project
directory (including subdirectories!). We can also do `cargo run` to build and
run. Notice that these commands will resolve all dependencies, download crates
if needed, and build everything, including your crate. (Note that it only
rebuilds what it has not already built, similar to `make`).

Voila! That's all there is to it!

FILE: src/cargo/test.md
================================================
# Testing

As we know testing is integral to any piece of software! Rust has first-class
support for unit and integration testing ([see this
chapter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-00-testing.html) in TRPL).

From the testing chapters linked above, we see how to write unit tests and
integration tests. Organizationally, we can place unit tests in the modules they
test and integration tests in their own `tests/` directory:

```txt
foo
├── Cargo.toml
├── src
│   └── main.rs
│   └── lib.rs
└── tests
    ├── my_test.rs
    └── my_other_test.rs
```

Each file in `tests` is a separate
[integration test](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html#integration-tests),
i.e. a test that is meant to test your library as if it were being called from a dependent
crate.

The [Testing][testing] chapter elaborates on the three different testing styles:
[Unit][unit_testing], [Doc][doc_testing], and [Integration][integration_testing].

`cargo` naturally provides an easy way to run all of your tests!

```shell
$ cargo test
```

You should see output like this:

```shell
$ cargo test
   Compiling blah v0.1.0 (file:///nobackup/blah)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.89 secs
     Running target/debug/deps/blah-d3b32b97275ec472

running 4 tests
test test_bar ... ok
test test_baz ... ok
test test_foo_bar ... ok
test test_foo ... ok

test result: ok. 4 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

You can also run tests whose name matches a pattern:

```shell
$ cargo test test_foo
```

```shell
$ cargo test test_foo
   Compiling blah v0.1.0 (file:///nobackup/blah)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.35 secs
     Running target/debug/deps/blah-d3b32b97275ec472

running 2 tests
test test_foo ... ok
test test_foo_bar ... ok

test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 2 filtered out
```

One word of caution: Cargo may run multiple tests concurrently, so make sure
that they don't race with each other.

One example of this concurrency causing issues is if two tests output to a
file, such as below:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    // Import the necessary modules
    use std::fs::OpenOptions;
    use std::io::Write;

    // This test writes to a file
    #[test]
    fn test_file() {
        // Opens the file ferris.txt or creates one if it doesn't exist.
        let mut file = OpenOptions::new()
            .append(true)
            .create(true)
            .open("ferris.txt")
            .expect("Failed to open ferris.txt");

        // Print "Ferris" 5 times.
        for _ in 0..5 {
            file.write_all("Ferris\n".as_bytes())
                .expect("Could not write to ferris.txt");
        }
    }

    // This test tries to write to the same file
    #[test]
    fn test_file_also() {
        // Opens the file ferris.txt or creates one if it doesn't exist.
        let mut file = OpenOptions::new()
            .append(true)
            .create(true)
            .open("ferris.txt")
            .expect("Failed to open ferris.txt");

        // Print "Corro" 5 times.
        for _ in 0..5 {
            file.write_all("Corro\n".as_bytes())
                .expect("Could not write to ferris.txt");
        }
    }
}
```

Although the intent is to get the following:

```shell
$ cat ferris.txt
Ferris
Ferris
Ferris
Ferris
Ferris
Corro
Corro
Corro
Corro
Corro
```

What actually gets put into `ferris.txt` is this:

```shell
$ cargo test test_file && cat ferris.txt
Corro
Ferris
Corro
Ferris
Corro
Ferris
Corro
Ferris
Corro
Ferris
```

================================================
FILE: src/compatibility/raw_identifiers.md
================================================
# Raw identifiers

Rust, like many programming languages, has the concept of "keywords".
These identifiers mean something to the language, and so you cannot use them in
places like variable names, function names, and other places.
Raw identifiers let you use keywords where they would not normally be allowed.
This is particularly useful when Rust introduces new keywords, and a library
using an older edition of Rust has a variable or function with the same name
as a keyword introduced in a newer edition.

For example, consider a crate `foo` compiled with the 2015 edition of Rust that
exports a function named `try`. This keyword is reserved for a new feature in
the 2018 edition, so without raw identifiers, we would have no way to name the
function.

```rust,ignore
extern crate foo;

fn main() {
    foo::try();
}
```

You'll get this error:

```text
error: expected identifier, found keyword `try`
 --> src/main.rs:4:4
  |
4 | foo::try();
  |      ^^^ expected identifier, found keyword
```

You can write this with a raw identifier:

```rust,ignore
extern crate foo;

fn main() {
    foo::r#try();
}
```



================================================
FILE: src/conversion/from_into.md
================================================
# `From` and `Into`

The [`From`] and [`Into`] traits are inherently linked, and this is actually part of
its implementation. If you are able to convert type A from type B, then it
should be easy to believe that we should be able to convert type B to type A.

## `From`

The [`From`] trait allows for a type to define how to create itself from another
type, hence providing a very simple mechanism for converting between several
types. There are numerous implementations of this trait within the standard
library for conversion of primitive and common types.

For example we can easily convert a `str` into a `String`

```rust
let my_str = "hello";
let my_string = String::from(my_str);
```

We can do something similar for defining a conversion for our own type.

```rust,editable
use std::convert::From;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Number {
    value: i32,
}

impl From<i32> for Number {
    fn from(item: i32) -> Self {
        Number { value: item }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let num = Number::from(30);
    println!("My number is {:?}", num);
}
```

## `Into`

The [`Into`] trait is simply the reciprocal of the `From` trait. It
defines how to convert a type into another type.

Calling `into()` typically requires us to specify the result type as the compiler is unable to determine this most of the time.

```rust,editable
use std::convert::Into;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Number {
    value: i32,
}

impl Into<Number> for i32 {
    fn into(self) -> Number {
        Number { value: self }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let int = 5;
    // Try removing the type annotation
    let num: Number = int.into();
    println!("My number is {:?}", num);
}
```

## `From` and `Into` are interchangeable

`From` and `Into` are designed to be complementary.
We do not need to provide an implementation for both traits.
If you have implemented the `From` trait for your type, `Into` will call it
when necessary. Note, however, that the converse is not true: implementing `Into` for your type will not automatically provide it with an implementation of `From`.

```rust,editable
use std::convert::From;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Number {
    value: i32,
}

// Define `From`
impl From<i32> for Number {
    fn from(item: i32) -> Self {
        Number { value: item }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let int = 5;
    // use `Into`
    let num: Number = int.into();
    println!("My number is {:?}", num);
}
```

[`Into`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.Into.html



================================================
FILE: src/conversion/string.md
================================================
# To and from Strings

## Converting to String

To convert any type to a `String` is as simple as implementing the [`ToString`]
trait for the type. Rather than doing so directly, you should implement the
[`fmt::Display`][Display] trait which automatically provides [`ToString`] and
also allows printing the type as discussed in the section on [`print!`][print].

```rust,editable
use std::fmt;

struct Circle {
    radius: i32
}

impl fmt::Display for Circle {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "Circle of radius {}", self.radius)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let circle = Circle { radius: 6 };
    println!("{}", circle.to_string());
}
```

## Parsing a String

It's useful to convert strings into many types, but one of the more common string
operations is to convert them from string to number. The idiomatic approach to
this is to use the [`parse`] function and either to arrange for type inference or
to specify the type to parse using the 'turbofish' syntax. Both alternatives are
shown in the following example.

This will convert the string into the type specified as long as the [`FromStr`]
trait is implemented for that type. This is implemented for numerous types
within the standard library.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let parsed: i32 = "5".parse().unwrap();
    let turbo_parsed = "10".parse::<i32>().unwrap();

    let sum = parsed + turbo_parsed;
    println!("Sum: {:?}", sum);
}
```

To obtain this functionality on a user defined type simply implement the
[`FromStr`] trait for that type.

```rust,editable
use std::num::ParseIntError;
use std::str::FromStr;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Circle {
    radius: i32,
}

impl FromStr for Circle {
    type Err = ParseIntError;
    fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> {
        match s.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => Ok(Circle{ radius: num }),
            Err(e) => Err(e),
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let radius = "    3 ";
    let circle: Circle = radius.parse().unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", circle);
}
```

# `TryFrom` and `TryInto`

Similar to [`From` and `Into`][from-into], [`TryFrom`] and [`TryInto`] are
generic traits for converting between types. Unlike `From`/`Into`, the
`TryFrom`/`TryInto` traits are used for fallible conversions, and as such,
return [`Result`]s.

# Creating a Library

Let's create a library, and then see how to link it to another crate.

In `rary.rs`:

```rust,ignore
pub fn public_function() {
    println!("called rary's `public_function()`");
}

fn private_function() {
    println!("called rary's `private_function()`");
}

pub fn indirect_access() {
    print!("called rary's `indirect_access()`, that\n> ");

    private_function();
}
```

```shell
$ rustc --crate-type=lib rary.rs
$ ls lib*
library.rlib
```

Libraries get prefixed with "lib", and by default they get named after their
crate file, but this default name can be overridden by passing
the `--crate-name` option to `rustc` or by using the [`crate_name`
attribute][crate-name].

[crate-name]: ../attribute/crate.md



================================================
FILE: src/crates/using_lib.md
================================================
# Using a Library

To link a crate to this new library you may use `rustc`'s `--extern` flag. All
of its items will then be imported under a module named the same as the library.
This module generally behaves the same way as any other module.

```rust,ignore
// extern crate rary; // May be required for Rust 2015 edition or earlier

fn main() {
    rary::public_function();

    // Error! `private_function` is private
    //rary::private_function();

    rary::indirect_access();
}
```

```txt
# Where library.rlib is the path to the compiled library, assumed that it's
# in the same directory here:
$ rustc executable.rs --extern rary=library.rlib && ./executable
called rary's `public_function()`
called rary's `indirect_access()`, that
> called rary's `private_function()`
```



================================================
FILE: src/custom_types/constants.md
================================================
# constants

Rust has two different types of constants which can be declared in any scope
including global. Both require explicit type annotation:

* `const`: An unchangeable value (the common case).
* `static`: A possibly mutable variable with [`'static`][static] lifetime.
  The static lifetime is inferred and does not have to be specified.
  Accessing or modifying a mutable static variable is [`unsafe`][unsafe].

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
// Globals are declared outside all other scopes.
static LANGUAGE: &str = "Rust";
const THRESHOLD: i32 = 10;

fn is_big(n: i32) -> bool {
    // Access constant in some function
    n > THRESHOLD
}

fn main() {
    let n = 16;

    // Access constant in the main thread
    println!("This is {}", LANGUAGE);
    println!("The threshold is {}", THRESHOLD);
    println!("{} is {}", n, if is_big(n) { "big" } else { "small" });

    // Error! Cannot modify a `const`.
    THRESHOLD = 5;
    // FIXME ^ Comment out this line
}
```

# Enums

The `enum` keyword allows the creation of a type which may be one of a few
different variants. Any variant which is valid as a `struct` is also valid in
an `enum`.

```rust,editable
// Create an `enum` to classify a web event. Note how both
// names and type information together specify the variant:
// `PageLoad != PageUnload` and `KeyPress(char) != Paste(String)`.
// Each is different and independent.
enum WebEvent {
    // An `enum` variant may either be `unit-like`,
    PageLoad,
    PageUnload,
    // like tuple structs,
    KeyPress(char),
    Paste(String),
    // or c-like structures.
    Click { x: i64, y: i64 },
}

// A function which takes a `WebEvent` enum as an argument and
// returns nothing.
fn inspect(event: WebEvent) {
    match event {
        WebEvent::PageLoad => println!("page loaded"),
        WebEvent::PageUnload => println!("page unloaded"),
        // Destructure `c` from inside the `enum` variant.
        WebEvent::KeyPress(c) => println!("pressed '{}'.", c),
        WebEvent::Paste(s) => println!("pasted \"{}\".", s),
        // Destructure `Click` into `x` and `y`.
        WebEvent::Click { x, y } => {
            println!("clicked at x={}, y={}.", x, y);
        },
    }
}

fn main() {
    let pressed = WebEvent::KeyPress('x');
    // `to_owned()` creates an owned `String` from a string slice.
    let pasted  = WebEvent::Paste("my text".to_owned());
    let click   = WebEvent::Click { x: 20, y: 80 };
    let load    = WebEvent::PageLoad;
    let unload  = WebEvent::PageUnload;

    inspect(pressed);
    inspect(pasted);
    inspect(click);
    inspect(load);
    inspect(unload);
}

```

## Type aliases

If you use a type alias, you can refer to each enum variant via its alias.
This might be useful if the enum's name is too long or too generic, and you
want to rename it.

```rust,editable
enum VeryVerboseEnumOfThingsToDoWithNumbers {
    Add,
    Subtract,
}

// Creates a type alias
type Operations = VeryVerboseEnumOfThingsToDoWithNumbers;

fn main() {
    // We can refer to each variant via its alias, not its long and inconvenient
    // name.
    let x = Operations::Add;
}
```

The most common place you'll see this is in `impl` blocks using the `Self` alias.

```rust,editable
enum VeryVerboseEnumOfThingsToDoWithNumbers {
    Add,
    Subtract,
}

impl VeryVerboseEnumOfThingsToDoWithNumbers {
    fn run(&self, x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
        match self {
            Self::Add => x + y,
            Self::Subtract => x - y,
        }
    }
}
```

To learn more about enums and type aliases, you can read the
[stabilization report][aliasreport] from when this feature was stabilized into
Rust.

# Structures

There are three types of structures ("structs") that can be created using the
`struct` keyword:

* Tuple structs, which are, basically, named tuples.
* The classic [C structs][c_struct]
* Unit structs, which are field-less, are useful for generics.

```rust,editable
// An attribute to hide warnings for unused code.
#![allow(dead_code)]

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
}

// A unit struct
struct Unit;

// A tuple struct
struct Pair(i32, f32);

// A struct with two fields
struct Point {
    x: f32,
    y: f32,
}

// Structs can be reused as fields of another struct
struct Rectangle {
    // A rectangle can be specified by where the top left and bottom right
    // corners are in space.
    top_left: Point,
    bottom_right: Point,
}

fn main() {
    // Create struct with field init shorthand
    let name = String::from("Peter");
    let age = 27;
    let peter = Person { name, age };

    // Print debug struct
    println!("{:?}", peter);

    // Instantiate a `Point`
    let point: Point = Point { x: 5.2, y: 0.4 };
    let another_point: Point = Point { x: 10.3, y: 0.2 };

    // Access the fields of the point
    println!("point coordinates: ({}, {})", point.x, point.y);

    // Make a new point by using struct update syntax to use the fields of our
    // other one
    let bottom_right = Point { x: 10.3, ..another_point };

    // `bottom_right.y` will be the same as `another_point.y` because we used that field
    // from `another_point`
    println!("second point: ({}, {})", bottom_right.x, bottom_right.y);

    // Destructure the point using a `let` binding
    let Point { x: left_edge, y: top_edge } = point;

    let _rectangle = Rectangle {
        // struct instantiation is an expression too
        top_left: Point { x: left_edge, y: top_edge },
        bottom_right: bottom_right,
    };

    // Instantiate a unit struct
    let _unit = Unit;

    // Instantiate a tuple struct
    let pair = Pair(1, 0.1);

    // Access the fields of a tuple struct
    println!("pair contains {:?} and {:?}", pair.0, pair.1);

    // Destructure a tuple struct
    let Pair(integer, decimal) = pair;

    println!("pair contains {:?} and {:?}", integer, decimal);
}
```

### Activity

1. Add a function `rect_area` which calculates the area of a `Rectangle` (try
   using nested destructuring).
2. Add a function `square` which takes a `Point` and a `f32` as arguments, and
   returns a `Rectangle` with its top left corner on the point, and a width and
   height corresponding to the `f32`.

FILE: src/custom_types/enum/testcase_linked_list.md
================================================
# Testcase: linked-list

A common way to implement a linked-list is via `enums`:

```rust,editable
use crate::List::*;

enum List {
    // Cons: Tuple struct that wraps an element and a pointer to the next node
    Cons(u32, Box<List>),
    // Nil: A node that signifies the end of the linked list
    Nil,
}

// Methods can be attached to an enum
impl List {
    // Create an empty list
    fn new() -> List {
        // `Nil` has type `List`
        Nil
    }

    // Consume a list, and return the same list with a new element at its front
    fn prepend(self, elem: u32) -> List {
        // `Cons` also has type List
        Cons(elem, Box::new(self))
    }

    // Return the length of the list
    fn len(&self) -> u32 {
        // `self` has to be matched, because the behavior of this method
        // depends on the variant of `self`
        // `self` has type `&List`, and `*self` has type `List`, matching on a
        // concrete type `T` is preferred over a match on a reference `&T`
        // after Rust 2018 you can use self here and tail (with no ref) below as well,
        // rust will infer &s and ref tail.
        // See https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/ownership-and-lifetimes/default-match-bindings.html
        match *self {
            // Can't take ownership of the tail, because `self` is borrowed;
            // instead take a reference to the tail
            // And it'a a non-tail recursive call which may cause stack overflow for long lists.
            Cons(_, ref tail) => 1 + tail.len(),
            // Base Case: An empty list has zero length
            Nil => 0
        }
    }

    // Return representation of the list as a (heap allocated) string
    fn stringify(&self) -> String {
        match *self {
            Cons(head, ref tail) => {
                // `format!` is similar to `print!`, but returns a heap
                // allocated string instead of printing to the console
                format!("{}, {}", head, tail.stringify())
            },
            Nil => {
                format!("Nil")
            },
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Create an empty linked list
    let mut list = List::new();

    // Prepend some elements
    list = list.prepend(1);
    list = list.prepend(2);
    list = list.prepend(3);

    // Show the final state of the list
    println!("linked list has length: {}", list.len());
    println!("{}", list.stringify());
}

FILE: src/error/abort_unwind.md
================================================
# `abort` and `unwind`

The previous section illustrates the error handling mechanism `panic`.  Different code paths can be conditionally compiled based on the panic setting. The current values available are `unwind` and `abort`.

Building on the prior lemonade example, we explicitly use the panic strategy to exercise different lines of code.

```rust,editable,mdbook-runnable
fn drink(beverage: &str) {
    // You shouldn't drink too much sugary beverages.
    if beverage == "lemonade" {
        if cfg!(panic = "abort") {
            println!("This is not your party. Run!!!!");
        } else {
            println!("Spit it out!!!!");
        }
    } else {
        println!("Some refreshing {} is all I need.", beverage);
    }
}

fn main() {
    drink("water");
    drink("lemonade");
}
```

Here is another example focusing on rewriting `drink()` and explicitly use the `unwind` keyword.

```rust,editable
#[cfg(panic = "unwind")]
fn ah() {
    println!("Spit it out!!!!");
}

#[cfg(not(panic = "unwind"))]
fn ah() {
    println!("This is not your party. Run!!!!");
}

fn drink(beverage: &str) {
    if beverage == "lemonade" {
        ah();
    } else {
        println!("Some refreshing {} is all I need.", beverage);
    }
}

fn main() {
    drink("water");
    drink("lemonade");
}
```

The panic strategy can be set from the command line by using `abort` or `unwind`.

```console
rustc  lemonade.rs -C panic=abort
```



================================================
FILE: src/error/iter_result.md
================================================
# Iterating over `Result`s

An `Iter::map` operation might fail, for example:

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let strings = vec!["tofu", "93", "18"];
    let numbers: Vec<_> = strings
        .into_iter()
        .map(|s| s.parse::<i32>())
        .collect();
    println!("Results: {:?}", numbers);
}
```

Let's step through strategies for handling this.

## Ignore the failed items with `filter_map()`

`filter_map` calls a function and filters out the results that are `None`.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let strings = vec!["tofu", "93", "18"];
    let numbers: Vec<_> = strings
        .into_iter()
        .filter_map(|s| s.parse::<i32>().ok())
        .collect();
    println!("Results: {:?}", numbers);
}
```

## Collect the failed items with `map_err()` and `filter_map()`

`map_err` calls a function with the error, so by adding that to the previous
`filter_map` solution we can save them off to the side while iterating.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let strings = vec!["42", "tofu", "93", "999", "18"];
    let mut errors = vec![];
    let numbers: Vec<_> = strings
        .into_iter()
        .map(|s| s.parse::<u8>())
        .filter_map(|r| r.map_err(|e| errors.push(e)).ok())
        .collect();
    println!("Numbers: {:?}", numbers);
    println!("Errors: {:?}", errors);
}
```

## Fail the entire operation with `collect()`

`Result` implements `FromIterator` so that a vector of results (`Vec<Result<T, E>>`)
can be turned into a result with a vector (`Result<Vec<T>, E>`). Once an
`Result::Err` is found, the iteration will terminate.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let strings = vec!["tofu", "93", "18"];
    let numbers: Result<Vec<_>, _> = strings
        .into_iter()
        .map(|s| s.parse::<i32>())
        .collect();
    println!("Results: {:?}", numbers);
}
```

This same technique can be used with `Option`.

## Collect all valid values and failures with `partition()`

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let strings = vec!["tofu", "93", "18"];
    let (numbers, errors): (Vec<_>, Vec<_>) = strings
        .into_iter()
        .map(|s| s.parse::<i32>())
        .partition(Result::is_ok);
    println!("Numbers: {:?}", numbers);
    println!("Errors: {:?}", errors);
}
```

When you look at the results, you'll note that everything is still wrapped in
`Result`.  A little more boilerplate is needed for this.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let strings = vec!["tofu", "93", "18"];
    let (numbers, errors): (Vec<_>, Vec<_>) = strings
        .into_iter()
        .map(|s| s.parse::<i32>())
        .partition(Result::is_ok);
    let numbers: Vec<_> = numbers.into_iter().map(Result::unwrap).collect();
    let errors: Vec<_> = errors.into_iter().map(Result::unwrap_err).collect();
    println!("Numbers: {:?}", numbers);
    println!("Errors: {:?}", errors);
}
```



================================================
FILE: src/error/multiple_error_types.md
================================================
# Multiple error types

The previous examples have always been very convenient; `Result`s interact
with other `Result`s and `Option`s interact with other `Option`s.

Sometimes an `Option` needs to interact with a `Result`, or a
`Result<T, Error1>` needs to interact with a `Result<T, Error2>`. In those
cases, we want to manage our different error types in a way that makes them
composable and easy to interact with.

In the following code, two instances of `unwrap` generate different error
types. `Vec::first` returns an `Option`, while `parse::<i32>` returns a
`Result<i32, ParseIntError>`:

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
fn double_first(vec: Vec<&str>) -> i32 {
    let first = vec.first().unwrap(); // Generate error 1
    2 * first.parse::<i32>().unwrap() // Generate error 2
}

fn main() {
    let numbers = vec!["42", "93", "18"];
    let empty = vec![];
    let strings = vec!["tofu", "93", "18"];

    println!("The first doubled is {}", double_first(numbers));

    println!("The first doubled is {}", double_first(empty));
    // Error 1: the input vector is empty

    println!("The first doubled is {}", double_first(strings));
    // Error 2: the element doesn't parse to a number
}
```

Over the next sections, we'll see several strategies for handling these kind of problems.



================================================
FILE: src/error/option_unwrap.md
================================================
# `Option` & `unwrap`

In the last example, we showed that we can induce program failure at will.
We told our program to `panic` if we drink a sugary lemonade.
But what if we expect _some_ drink but don't receive one?
That case would be just as bad, so it needs to be handled!

We _could_ test this against the null string (`""`) as we do with a lemonade.
Since we're using Rust, let's instead have the compiler point out cases
where there's no drink.

An `enum` called `Option<T>` in the `std` library is used when absence is a
possibility. It manifests itself as one of two "options":

* `Some(T)`: An element of type `T` was found
* `None`: No element was found

These cases can either be explicitly handled via `match` or implicitly with
`unwrap`. Implicit handling will either return the inner element or `panic`.

Note that it's possible to manually customize `panic` with [expect][expect],
but `unwrap` otherwise leaves us with a less meaningful output than explicit
handling. In the following example, explicit handling yields a more
controlled result while retaining the option to `panic` if desired.

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
// The adult has seen it all, and can handle any drink well.
// All drinks are handled explicitly using `match`.
fn give_adult(drink: Option<&str>) {
    // Specify a course of action for each case.
    match drink {
        Some("lemonade") => println!("Yuck! Too sugary."),
        Some(inner)   => println!("{}? How nice.", inner),
        None          => println!("No drink? Oh well."),
    }
}

// Others will `panic` before drinking sugary drinks.
// All drinks are handled implicitly using `unwrap`.
fn drink(drink: Option<&str>) {
    // `unwrap` returns a `panic` when it receives a `None`.
    let inside = drink.unwrap();
    if inside == "lemonade" { panic!("AAAaaaaa!!!!"); }

    println!("I love {}s!!!!!", inside);
}

fn main() {
    let water  = Some("water");
    let lemonade = Some("lemonade");
    let void  = None;

    give_adult(water);
    give_adult(lemonade);
    give_adult(void);

    let coffee = Some("coffee");
    let nothing = None;

    drink(coffee);
    drink(nothing);
}
```

[expect]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.expect



================================================
FILE: src/error/panic.md
================================================
# `panic`

The simplest error handling mechanism we will see is `panic`. It prints an
error message, starts unwinding the stack, and usually exits the program.
Here, we explicitly call `panic` on our error condition:

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
fn drink(beverage: &str) {
    // You shouldn't drink too many sugary beverages.
    if beverage == "lemonade" { panic!("AAAaaaaa!!!!"); }

    println!("Some refreshing {} is all I need.", beverage);
}

fn main() {
    drink("water");
    drink("lemonade");
    drink("still water");
}
```

The first call to `drink` works. The second panics and thus the third is never called.



================================================
FILE: src/error/result.md
================================================
# `Result`

[`Result`][result] is a richer version of the [`Option`][option] type that
describes possible *error* instead of possible *absence*.

That is, `Result<T, E>` could have one of two outcomes:

* `Ok(T)`: An element `T` was found
* `Err(E)`: An error was found with element `E`

By convention, the expected outcome is `Ok` while the unexpected outcome is `Err`.

Like `Option`, `Result` has many methods associated with it. `unwrap()`, for
example, either yields the element `T` or `panic`s. For case handling,
there are many combinators between `Result` and `Option` that overlap.

In working with Rust, you will likely encounter methods that return the
`Result` type, such as the [`parse()`][parse] method. It might not always
be possible to parse a string into the other type, so `parse()` returns a
`Result` indicating possible failure.

Let's see what happens when we successfully and unsuccessfully `parse()` a string:

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
fn multiply(first_number_str: &str, second_number_str: &str) -> i32 {
    // Let's try using `unwrap()` to get the number out. Will it bite us?
    let first_number = first_number_str.parse::<i32>().unwrap();
    let second_number = second_number_str.parse::<i32>().unwrap();
    first_number * second_number
}

fn main() {
    let twenty = multiply("10", "2");
    println!("double is {}", twenty);

    let tt = multiply("t", "2");
    println!("double is {}", tt);
}
```

In the unsuccessful case, `parse()` leaves us with an error for `unwrap()`
to `panic` on. Additionally, the `panic` exits our program and provides an
unpleasant error message.

To improve the quality of our error message, we should be more specific
about the return type and consider explicitly handling the error.

## Using `Result` in `main`

The `Result` type can also be the return type of the `main` function if
specified explicitly. Typically the `main` function will be of the form:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

However `main` is also able to have a return type of `Result`. If an error
occurs within the `main` function it will return an error code and print a debug
representation of the error (using the [`Debug`] trait). The following example
shows such a scenario and touches on aspects covered in [the following section].

```rust,editable
use std::num::ParseIntError;

fn main() -> Result<(), ParseIntError> {
    let number_str = "10";
    let number = match number_str.parse::<i32>() {
        Ok(number)  => number,
        Err(e) => return Err(e),
    };
    println!("{}", number);
    Ok(())
}
```

================================================
FILE: src/error/multiple_error_types/boxing_errors.md
================================================
# `Box`ing errors

A way to write simple code while preserving the original errors is to [`Box`][box]
them.  The drawback is that the underlying error type is only known at runtime and not
[statically determined][dynamic_dispatch].

The stdlib helps in boxing our errors by having `Box` implement conversion from
any type that implements the `Error` trait into the trait object `Box<Error>`,
via [`From`][from].

```rust,editable
use std::error;
use std::fmt;

# Defining an error type

Sometimes it simplifies the code to mask all of the different errors with a
single type of error.  We'll show this with a custom error.

Rust allows us to define our own error types. In general, a "good" error type:

* Represents different errors with the same type
* Presents nice error messages to the user
* Is easy to compare with other types
  * Good: `Err(EmptyVec)`
  * Bad: `Err("Please use a vector with at least one element".to_owned())`
* Can hold information about the error
  * Good: `Err(BadChar(c, position))`
  * Bad: `Err("+ cannot be used here".to_owned())`
* Composes well with other errors

```rust,editable
use std::fmt;

type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, DoubleError>;

// Define our error types. These may be customized for our error handling cases.
// Now we will be able to write our own errors, defer to an underlying error
// implementation, or do something in between.
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct DoubleError;

// Generation of an error is completely separate from how it is displayed.
// There's no need to be concerned about cluttering complex logic with the display style.
//
// Note that we don't store any extra info about the errors. This means we can't state
// which string failed to parse without modifying our types to carry that information.
impl fmt::Display for DoubleError {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "invalid first item to double")
    }
}

fn double_first(vec: Vec<&str>) -> Result<i32> {
    vec.first()
        // Change the error to our new type.
        .ok_or(DoubleError)
        .and_then(|s| {
            s.parse::<i32>()
                // Update to the new error type here also.
                .map_err(|_| DoubleError)
                .map(|i| 2 * i)
        })
}

fn print(result: Result<i32>) {
    match result {
        Ok(n) => println!("The first doubled is {}", n),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}

fn main() {
    let numbers = vec!["42", "93", "18"];
    let empty = vec![];
    let strings = vec!["tofu", "93", "18"];

    print(double_first(numbers));
    print(double_first(empty));
    print(double_first(strings));
}
```

# Pulling `Result`s out of `Option`s

The most basic way of handling mixed error types is to just embed them in each
other.

```rust,editable
use std::num::ParseIntError;

fn double_first(vec: Vec<&str>) -> Option<Result<i32, ParseIntError>> {
    vec.first().map(|first| {
        first.parse::<i32>().map(|n| 2 * n)
    })
}

fn main() {
    let numbers = vec!["42", "93", "18"];
    let empty = vec![];
    let strings = vec!["tofu", "93", "18"];

    println!("The first doubled is {:?}", double_first(numbers));

    println!("The first doubled is {:?}", double_first(empty));
    // Error 1: the input vector is empty

    println!("The first doubled is {:?}", double_first(strings));
    // Error 2: the element doesn't parse to a number
}
```

There are times when we'll want to stop processing on errors (like with
[`?`][enter_question_mark]) but keep going when the `Option` is `None`. The `transpose` function comes in handy to swap the `Result` and `Option`.

```rust,editable
use std::num::ParseIntError;

fn double_first(vec: Vec<&str>) -> Result<Option<i32>, ParseIntError> {
    let opt = vec.first().map(|first| {
        first.parse::<i32>().map(|n| 2 * n)
    });

    opt.transpose()
}

fn main() {
    let numbers = vec!["42", "93", "18"];
    let empty = vec![];
    let strings = vec!["tofu", "93", "18"];

    println!("The first doubled is {:?}", double_first(numbers));
    println!("The first doubled is {:?}", double_first(empty));
    println!("The first doubled is {:?}", double_first(strings));
}
```

# Other uses of `?`

Notice in the previous example that our immediate reaction to calling
`parse` is to `map` the error from a library error into a boxed
error:

```rust,ignore
.and_then(|s| s.parse::<i32>())
    .map_err(|e| e.into())
```

Since this is a simple and common operation, it would be convenient if it
could be elided. Alas, because `and_then` is not sufficiently flexible, it
cannot. However, we can instead use `?`.

`?` was previously explained as either `unwrap` or `return Err(err)`.
This is only mostly true. It actually means `unwrap` or
`return Err(From::from(err))`. Since `From::from` is a conversion utility
between different types, this means that if you `?` where the error is
convertible to the return type, it will convert automatically.

Here, we rewrite the previous example using `?`. As a result, the
`map_err` will go away when `From::from` is implemented for our error type:

```rust,editable
use std::error;
use std::fmt;

// Change the alias to use `Box<dyn error::Error>`.
type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, Box<dyn error::Error>>;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct EmptyVec;

impl fmt::Display for EmptyVec {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "invalid first item to double")
    }
}

impl error::Error for EmptyVec {}

// The same structure as before but rather than chain all `Results`
// and `Options` along, we `?` to get the inner value out immediately.
fn double_first(vec: Vec<&str>) -> Result<i32> {
    let first = vec.first().ok_or(EmptyVec)?;
    let parsed = first.parse::<i32>()?;
    Ok(2 * parsed)
}

fn print(result: Result<i32>) {
    match result {
        Ok(n)  => println!("The first doubled is {}", n),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}

fn main() {
    let numbers = vec!["42", "93", "18"];
    let empty = vec![];
    let strings = vec!["tofu", "93", "18"];

    print(double_first(numbers));
    print(double_first(empty));
    print(double_first(strings));
}
```

This is actually fairly clean now. Compared with the original `panic`, it
is very similar to replacing the `unwrap` calls with `?` except that the
return types are `Result`. As a result, they must be destructured at the
top level.

# Wrapping errors

An alternative to boxing errors is to wrap them in your own error type.

use std::error;
use std::error::Error;
use std::num::ParseIntError;
use std::fmt;

type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, DoubleError>;

#[derive(Debug)]
enum DoubleError {
    EmptyVec,
    // We will defer to the parse error implementation for their error.
    // Supplying extra info requires adding more data to the type.
    Parse(ParseIntError),
}

impl fmt::Display for DoubleError {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        match *self {
            DoubleError::EmptyVec =>
                write!(f, "please use a vector with at least one element"),
            // The wrapped error contains additional information and is available
            // via the source() method.
            DoubleError::Parse(..) =>
                write!(f, "the provided string could not be parsed as int"),
        }
    }
}

impl error::Error for DoubleError {
    fn source(&self) -> Option<&(dyn error::Error + 'static)> {
        match *self {
            DoubleError::EmptyVec => None,
            // The cause is the underlying implementation error type. Is implicitly
            // cast to the trait object `&error::Error`. This works because the
            // underlying type already implements the `Error` trait.
            DoubleError::Parse(ref e) => Some(e),
        }
    }
}

// Implement the conversion from `ParseIntError` to `DoubleError`.
// This will be automatically called by `?` if a `ParseIntError`
// needs to be converted into a `DoubleError`.
impl From<ParseIntError> for DoubleError {
    fn from(err: ParseIntError) -> DoubleError {
        DoubleError::Parse(err)
    }
}

fn double_first(vec: Vec<&str>) -> Result<i32> {
    let first = vec.first().ok_or(DoubleError::EmptyVec)?;
    // Here we implicitly use the `ParseIntError` implementation of `From` (which
    // we defined above) in order to create a `DoubleError`.
    let parsed = first.parse::<i32>()?;

    Ok(2 * parsed)
}

fn print(result: Result<i32>) {
    match result {
        Ok(n)  => println!("The first doubled is {}", n),
        Err(e) => {
            println!("Error: {}", e);
            if let Some(source) = e.source() {
                println!("  Caused by: {}", source);
            }
        },
    }
}

fn main() {
    let numbers = vec!["42", "93", "18"];
    let empty = vec![];
    let strings = vec!["tofu", "93", "18"];

    print(double_first(numbers));
    print(double_first(empty));
    print(double_first(strings));
}
```

This adds a bit more boilerplate for handling errors and might not be needed in
all applications. There are some libraries that can take care of the boilerplate
for you.

# Combinators: `and_then`

`map()` was described as a chainable way to simplify `match` statements.
However, using `map()` on a function that returns an `Option<T>` results
in the nested `Option<Option<T>>`. Chaining multiple calls together can
then become confusing. That's where another combinator called `and_then()`,
known in some languages as flatmap, comes in.

`and_then()` calls its function input with the wrapped value and returns the result. If the `Option` is `None`, then it returns `None` instead.

In the following example, `cookable_v3()` results in an `Option<Food>`.
Using `map()` instead of `and_then()` would have given an
`Option<Option<Food>>`, which is an invalid type for `eat()`.

```rust,editable
#![allow(dead_code)]

#[derive(Debug)] enum Food { CordonBleu, Steak, Sushi }
#[derive(Debug)] enum Day { Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday }

// We don't have the ingredients to make Sushi.
fn have_ingredients(food: Food) -> Option<Food> {
    match food {
        Food::Sushi => None,
        _           => Some(food),
    }
}

// We have the recipe for everything except Cordon Bleu.
fn have_recipe(food: Food) -> Option<Food> {
    match food {
        Food::CordonBleu => None,
        _                => Some(food),
    }
}

// To make a dish, we need both the recipe and the ingredients.
// We can represent the logic with a chain of `match`es:
fn cookable_v1(food: Food) -> Option<Food> {
    match have_recipe(food) {
        None       => None,
        Some(food) => have_ingredients(food),
    }
}

// This can conveniently be rewritten more compactly with `and_then()`:
fn cookable_v3(food: Food) -> Option<Food> {
    have_recipe(food).and_then(have_ingredients)
}

// Otherwise we'd need to `flatten()` an `Option<Option<Food>>`
// to get an `Option<Food>`:
fn cookable_v2(food: Food) -> Option<Food> {
    have_recipe(food).map(have_ingredients).flatten()
}

fn eat(food: Food, day: Day) {
    match cookable_v3(food) {
        Some(food) => println!("Yay! On {:?} we get to eat {:?}.", day, food),
        None       => println!("Oh no. We don't get to eat on {:?}?", day),
    }
}

fn main() {
    let (cordon_bleu, steak, sushi) = (Food::CordonBleu, Food::Steak, Food::Sushi);

    eat(cordon_bleu, Day::Monday);
    eat(steak, Day::Tuesday);
    eat(sushi, Day::Wednesday);
}
```

FILE: src/error/option_unwrap/defaults.md
================================================
# Unpacking options and defaults

There is more than one way to unpack an `Option` and fall back on a default if it is `None`. To choose the one that meets our needs, we need to consider the following:

* do we need eager or lazy evaluation?
* do we need to keep the original empty value intact, or modify it in place?

## `or()` is chainable, evaluates eagerly, keeps empty value intact

`or()`is chainable and eagerly evaluates its argument, as is shown in the following example. Note that because `or`'s arguments are evaluated eagerly, the variable passed to `or` is moved.

```rust,editable
#[derive(Debug)]
enum Fruit { Apple, Orange, Banana, Kiwi, Lemon }

fn main() {
    let apple = Some(Fruit::Apple);
    let orange = Some(Fruit::Orange);
    let no_fruit: Option<Fruit> = None;

    let first_available_fruit = no_fruit.or(orange).or(apple);
    println!("first_available_fruit: {:?}", first_available_fruit);
    // first_available_fruit: Some(Orange)

    // `or` moves its argument.
    // In the example above, `or(orange)` returned a `Some`, so `or(apple)` was not invoked.
    // But the variable named `apple` has been moved regardless, and cannot be used anymore.
    // println!("Variable apple was moved, so this line won't compile: {:?}", apple);
    // TODO: uncomment the line above to see the compiler error
}
```

## `or_else()` is chainable, evaluates lazily, keeps empty value intact

Another alternative is to use `or_else`, which is also chainable, and evaluates lazily, as is shown in the following example:

```rust,editable
#[derive(Debug)]
enum Fruit { Apple, Orange, Banana, Kiwi, Lemon }

fn main() {
    let no_fruit: Option<Fruit> = None;
    let get_kiwi_as_fallback = || {
        println!("Providing kiwi as fallback");
        Some(Fruit::Kiwi)
    };
    let get_lemon_as_fallback = || {
        println!("Providing lemon as fallback");
        Some(Fruit::Lemon)
    };

    let first_available_fruit = no_fruit
        .or_else(get_kiwi_as_fallback)
        .or_else(get_lemon_as_fallback);
    println!("first_available_fruit: {:?}", first_available_fruit);
    // Providing kiwi as fallback
    // first_available_fruit: Some(Kiwi)
}
```

## `get_or_insert()` evaluates eagerly, modifies empty value in place

To make sure that an `Option` contains a value, we can use `get_or_insert` to modify it in place with a fallback value, as is shown in the following example. Note that `get_or_insert` eagerly evaluates its parameter, so variable `apple` is moved:

```rust,editable
#[derive(Debug)]
enum Fruit { Apple, Orange, Banana, Kiwi, Lemon }

fn main() {
    let mut my_fruit: Option<Fruit> = None;
    let apple = Fruit::Apple;
    let first_available_fruit = my_fruit.get_or_insert(apple);
    println!("first_available_fruit is: {:?}", first_available_fruit);
    println!("my_fruit is: {:?}", my_fruit);
    // first_available_fruit is: Apple
    // my_fruit is: Some(Apple)
    //println!("Variable named `apple` is moved: {:?}", apple);
    // TODO: uncomment the line above to see the compiler error
}
```

## `get_or_insert_with()` evaluates lazily, modifies empty value in place

Instead of explicitly providing a value to fall back on, we can pass a closure to `get_or_insert_with`, as follows:

```rust,editable
#[derive(Debug)]
enum Fruit { Apple, Orange, Banana, Kiwi, Lemon }

fn main() {
    let mut my_fruit: Option<Fruit> = None;
    let get_lemon_as_fallback = || {
        println!("Providing lemon as fallback");
        Fruit::Lemon
    };
    let first_available_fruit = my_fruit
        .get_or_insert_with(get_lemon_as_fallback);
    println!("first_available_fruit is: {:?}", first_available_fruit);
    println!("my_fruit is: {:?}", my_fruit);
    // Providing lemon as fallback
    // first_available_fruit is: Lemon
    // my_fruit is: Some(Lemon)

    // If the Option has a value, it is left unchanged, and the closure is not invoked
    let mut my_apple = Some(Fruit::Apple);
    let should_be_apple = my_apple.get_or_insert_with(get_lemon_as_fallback);
    println!("should_be_apple is: {:?}", should_be_apple);
    println!("my_apple is unchanged: {:?}", my_apple);
    // The output is a follows. Note that the closure `get_lemon_as_fallback` is not invoked
    // should_be_apple is: Apple
    // my_apple is unchanged: Some(Apple)
}
```

# Combinators: `map`

`match` is a valid method for handling `Option`s. However, you may
eventually find heavy usage tedious, especially with operations only valid
with an input. In these cases, [combinators][combinators] can be used to
manage control flow in a modular fashion.

`Option` has a built in method called `map()`, a combinator for the simple
mapping of `Some -> Some` and `None -> None`. Multiple `map()` calls can be
chained together for even more flexibility.

In the following example, `process()` replaces all functions previous
to it while staying compact.

```rust,editable
#![allow(dead_code)]

#[derive(Debug)] enum Food { Apple, Carrot, Potato }

#[derive(Debug)] struct Peeled(Food);
#[derive(Debug)] struct Chopped(Food);
#[derive(Debug)] struct Cooked(Food);

// Peeling food. If there isn't any, then return `None`.
// Otherwise, return the peeled food.
fn peel(food: Option<Food>) -> Option<Peeled> {
    match food {
        Some(food) => Some(Peeled(food)),
        None       => None,
    }
}

// Chopping food. If there isn't any, then return `None`.
// Otherwise, return the chopped food.
fn chop(peeled: Option<Peeled>) -> Option<Chopped> {
    match peeled {
        Some(Peeled(food)) => Some(Chopped(food)),
        None               => None,
    }
}

// Cooking food. Here, we showcase `map()` instead of `match` for case handling.
fn cook(chopped: Option<Chopped>) -> Option<Cooked> {
    chopped.map(|Chopped(food)| Cooked(food))
}

// A function to peel, chop, and cook food all in sequence.
// We chain multiple uses of `map()` to simplify the code.
fn process(food: Option<Food>) -> Option<Cooked> {
    food.map(|f| Peeled(f))
        .map(|Peeled(f)| Chopped(f))
        .map(|Chopped(f)| Cooked(f))
}

// Check whether there's food or not before trying to eat it!
fn eat(food: Option<Cooked>) {
    match food {
        Some(food) => println!("Mmm. I love {:?}", food),
        None       => println!("Oh no! It wasn't edible."),
    }
}

fn main() {
    let apple = Some(Food::Apple);
    let carrot = Some(Food::Carrot);
    let potato = None;

    let cooked_apple = cook(chop(peel(apple)));
    let cooked_carrot = cook(chop(peel(carrot)));
    // Let's try the simpler looking `process()` now.
    let cooked_potato = process(potato);

    eat(cooked_apple);
    eat(cooked_carrot);
    eat(cooked_potato);
}

# Unpacking options with `?`

You can unpack `Option`s by using `match` statements, but it's often easier to
use the `?` operator. If `x` is an `Option`, then evaluating `x?` will return
the underlying value if `x` is `Some`, otherwise it will terminate whatever
function is being executed and return `None`.

```rust,ignore
fn next_birthday(current_age: Option<u8>) -> Option<String> {
    // If `current_age` is `None`, this returns `None`.
    // If `current_age` is `Some`, the inner `u8` value + 1
    // gets assigned to `next_age`
    let next_age: u8 = current_age? + 1;
    Some(format!("Next year I will be {}", next_age))
}
```

You can chain many `?`s together to make your code much more readable.

```rust,editable
struct Person {
    job: Option<Job>,
}

#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct Job {
    phone_number: Option<PhoneNumber>,
}

#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct PhoneNumber {
    area_code: Option<u8>,
    number: u32,
}

impl Person {

    // Gets the area code of the phone number of the person's job, if it exists.
    fn work_phone_area_code(&self) -> Option<u8> {
        // This would need many nested `match` statements without the `?` operator.
        // It would take a lot more code - try writing it yourself and see which
        // is easier.
        self.job?.phone_number?.area_code
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Person {
        job: Some(Job {
            phone_number: Some(PhoneNumber {
                area_code: Some(61),
                number: 439222222,
            }),
        }),
    };

    assert_eq!(p.work_phone_area_code(), Some(61));
}
```

# Early returns

In the previous example, we explicitly handled the errors using combinators.
Another way to deal with this case analysis is to use a combination of
`match` statements and *early returns*.

That is, we can simply stop executing the function and return the error if
one occurs. For some, this form of code can be easier to both read and
write. Consider this version of the previous example, rewritten using early returns:

```rust,editable
use std::num::ParseIntError;

fn multiply(first_number_str: &str, second_number_str: &str) -> Result<i32, ParseIntError> {
    let first_number = match first_number_str.parse::<i32>() {
        Ok(first_number)  => first_number,
        Err(e) => return Err(e),
    };

    let second_number = match second_number_str.parse::<i32>() {
        Ok(second_number)  => second_number,
        Err(e) => return Err(e),
    };

    Ok(first_number * second_number)
}

fn print(result: Result<i32, ParseIntError>) {
    match result {
        Ok(n)  => println!("n is {}", n),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}

fn main() {
    print(multiply("10", "2"));
    print(multiply("t", "2"));
}
```

At this point, we've learned to explicitly handle errors using combinators
and early returns. While we generally want to avoid panicking, explicitly
handling all of our errors is cumbersome.

In the next section, we'll introduce `?` for the cases where we simply
need to `unwrap` without possibly inducing `panic`.



================================================
FILE: src/error/result/enter_question_mark.md
================================================
# Introducing `?`

Sometimes we just want the simplicity of `unwrap` without the possibility of
a `panic`. Until now, `unwrap` has forced us to nest deeper and deeper when
what we really wanted was to get the variable *out*. This is exactly the purpose of `?`.

Upon finding an `Err`, there are two valid actions to take:

1. `panic!` which we already decided to try to avoid if possible
2. `return` because an `Err` means it cannot be handled

`?` is *almost*[^†] exactly equivalent to an `unwrap` which `return`s
instead of `panic`king on `Err`s. Let's see how we can simplify the earlier
example that used combinators:

```rust,editable
use std::num::ParseIntError;

fn multiply(first_number_str: &str, second_number_str: &str) -> Result<i32, ParseIntError> {
    let first_number = first_number_str.parse::<i32>()?;
    let second_number = second_number_str.parse::<i32>()?;

    Ok(first_number * second_number)
}

fn print(result: Result<i32, ParseIntError>) {
    match result {
        Ok(n)  => println!("n is {}", n),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}

fn main() {
    print(multiply("10", "2"));
    print(multiply("t", "2"));
}
```

## The `try!` macro

Before there was `?`, the same functionality was achieved with the `try!` macro.
The `?` operator is now recommended, but you may still find `try!` when looking
at older code. The same `multiply` function from the previous example
would look like this using `try!`:

```rust,editable,edition2015
// To compile and run this example without errors, while using Cargo, change the value
// of the `edition` field, in the `[package]` section of the `Cargo.toml` file, to "2015".

use std::num::ParseIntError;

fn multiply(first_number_str: &str, second_number_str: &str) -> Result<i32, ParseIntError> {
    let first_number = try!(first_number_str.parse::<i32>());
    let second_number = try!(second_number_str.parse::<i32>());

    Ok(first_number * second_number)
}

fn print(result: Result<i32, ParseIntError>) {
    match result {
        Ok(n)  => println!("n is {}", n),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}

fn main() {
    print(multiply("10", "2"));
    print(multiply("t", "2"));
}
```

FILE: src/error/result/result_alias.md
================================================
# aliases for `Result`

How about when we want to reuse a specific `Result` type many times?
Recall that Rust allows us to create [aliases][typealias]. Conveniently,
we can define one for the specific `Result` in question.

At a module level, creating aliases can be particularly helpful. Errors
found in a specific module often have the same `Err` type, so a single alias
can succinctly define *all* associated `Results`. This is so useful that the
`std` library even supplies one: [`io::Result`][io_result]!

Here's a quick example to show off the syntax:

```rust,editable
use std::num::ParseIntError;

// Define a generic alias for a `Result` with the error type `ParseIntError`.
type AliasedResult<T> = Result<T, ParseIntError>;

// Use the above alias to refer to our specific `Result` type.
fn multiply(first_number_str: &str, second_number_str: &str) -> AliasedResult<i32> {
    first_number_str.parse::<i32>().and_then(|first_number| {
        second_number_str.parse::<i32>().map(|second_number| first_number * second_number)
    })
}

// Here, the alias again allows us to save some space.
fn print(result: AliasedResult<i32>) {
    match result {
        Ok(n)  => println!("n is {}", n),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}

fn main() {
    print(multiply("10", "2"));
    print(multiply("t", "2"));
}
```

================================================
FILE: src/error/result/result_map.md
================================================
# `map` for `Result`

Panicking in the previous example's `multiply` does not make for robust code.
Generally, we want to return the error to the caller so it can decide what is
the right way to respond to errors.

We first need to know what kind of error type we are dealing with. To determine
the `Err` type, we look to [`parse()`][parse], which is implemented with the
[`FromStr`][from_str] trait for [`i32`][i32]. As a result, the `Err` type is
specified as [`ParseIntError`][parse_int_error].

In the example below, the straightforward `match` statement leads to code
that is overall more cumbersome.

```rust,editable
use std::num::ParseIntError;

// With the return type rewritten, we use pattern matching without `unwrap()`.
fn multiply(first_number_str: &str, second_number_str: &str) -> Result<i32, ParseIntError> {
    match first_number_str.parse::<i32>() {
        Ok(first_number)  => {
            match second_number_str.parse::<i32>() {
                Ok(second_number)  => {
                    Ok(first_number * second_number)
                },
                Err(e) => Err(e),
            }
        },
        Err(e) => Err(e),
    }
}

fn print(result: Result<i32, ParseIntError>) {
    match result {
        Ok(n)  => println!("n is {}", n),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}

fn main() {
    // This still presents a reasonable answer.
    let twenty = multiply("10", "2");
    print(twenty);

    // The following now provides a much more helpful error message.
    let tt = multiply("t", "2");
    print(tt);
}
```

Luckily, `Option`'s `map`, `and_then`, and many other combinators are also
implemented for `Result`. [`Result`][result] contains a complete listing.

```rust,editable
use std::num::ParseIntError;

// As with `Option`, we can use combinators such as `map()`.
// This function is otherwise identical to the one above and reads:
// Multiply if both values can be parsed from str, otherwise pass on the error.
fn multiply(first_number_str: &str, second_number_str: &str) -> Result<i32, ParseIntError> {
    first_number_str.parse::<i32>().and_then(|first_number| {
        second_number_str.parse::<i32>().map(|second_number| first_number * second_number)
    })
}

fn print(result: Result<i32, ParseIntError>) {
    match result {
        Ok(n)  => println!("n is {}", n),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}

fn main() {
    // This still presents a reasonable answer.
    let twenty = multiply("10", "2");
    print(twenty);

    // The following now provides a much more helpful error message.
    let tt = multiply("t", "2");
    print(tt);
}
```

================================================
# for loops

## for and range

The `for in` construct can be used to iterate through an `Iterator`.
One of the easiest ways to create an iterator is to use the range
notation `a..b`. This yields values from `a` (inclusive) to `b`
(exclusive) in steps of one.

Let's write FizzBuzz using `for` instead of `while`.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    // `n` will take the values: 1, 2, ..., 100 in each iteration
    for n in 1..101 {
        if n % 15 == 0 {
            println!("fizzbuzz");
        } else if n % 3 == 0 {
            println!("fizz");
        } else if n % 5 == 0 {
            println!("buzz");
        } else {
            println!("{}", n);
        }
    }
}
```

Alternatively, `a..=b` can be used for a range that is inclusive on both ends.
The above can be written as:

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    // `n` will take the values: 1, 2, ..., 100 in each iteration
    for n in 1..=100 {
        if n % 15 == 0 {
            println!("fizzbuzz");
        } else if n % 3 == 0 {
            println!("fizz");
        } else if n % 5 == 0 {
            println!("buzz");
        } else {
            println!("{}", n);
        }
    }
}
```

## for and iterators

The `for in` construct is able to interact with an `Iterator` in several ways.
As discussed in the section on the [Iterator][iter] trait, by default the `for`
loop will apply the `into_iter` function to the collection. However, this is
not the only means of converting collections into iterators.

`into_iter`, `iter` and `iter_mut` all handle the conversion of a collection
into an iterator in different ways, by providing different views on the data
within.

* `iter` - This borrows each element of the collection through each iteration.
  Thus leaving the collection untouched and available for reuse after the loop.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let names = vec!["Bob", "Frank", "Ferris"];

    for name in names.iter() {
        match name {
            &"Ferris" => println!("There is a rustacean among us!"),
            // TODO ^ Try deleting the & and matching just "Ferris"
            _ => println!("Hello {}", name),
        }
    }

    println!("names: {:?}", names);
}
```

* `into_iter` - This consumes the collection so that on each iteration the exact
  data is provided. Once the collection has been consumed it is no longer
  available for reuse as it has been 'moved' within the loop.

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
fn main() {
    let names = vec!["Bob", "Frank", "Ferris"];

    for name in names.into_iter() {
        match name {
            "Ferris" => println!("There is a rustacean among us!"),
            _ => println!("Hello {}", name),
        }
    }

    println!("names: {:?}", names);
    // FIXME ^ Comment out this line
}
```

* `iter_mut` - This mutably borrows each element of the collection, allowing for
  the collection to be modified in place.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let mut names = vec!["Bob", "Frank", "Ferris"];

    for name in names.iter_mut() {
        *name = match name {
            &mut "Ferris" => "There is a rustacean among us!",
            _ => "Hello",
        }
    }

    println!("names: {:?}", names);
}
```

In the above snippets note the type of `match` branch, that is the key
difference in the types of iteration. The difference in type then of course
implies differing actions that are able to be performed.

FILE: src/flow_control/if_else.md
================================================
# if/else

Branching with `if`-`else` is similar to other languages. Unlike many of them,
the boolean condition doesn't need to be surrounded by parentheses, and each
condition is followed by a block. `if`-`else` conditionals are expressions,
and, all branches must return the same type.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let n = 5;

    if n < 0 {
        print!("{} is negative", n);
    } else if n > 0 {
        print!("{} is positive", n);
    } else {
        print!("{} is zero", n);
    }

    let big_n =
        if n < 10 && n > -10 {
            println!(", and is a small number, increase ten-fold");

            // This expression returns an `i32`.
            10 * n
        } else {
            println!(", and is a big number, halve the number");

            // This expression must return an `i32` as well.
            n / 2
            // TODO ^ Try suppressing this expression with a semicolon.
        };
    //   ^ Don't forget to put a semicolon here! All `let` bindings need it.

    println!("{} -> {}", n, big_n);
}
```



================================================
FILE: src/flow_control/if_let.md
================================================
# if let

For some use cases, when matching enums, `match` is awkward. For example:

```rust
// Make `optional` of type `Option<i32>`
let optional = Some(7);

match optional {
    Some(i) => println!("This is a really long string and `{:?}`", i),
    _ => {},
    // ^ Required because `match` is exhaustive. Doesn't it seem
    // like wasted space?
};

```

`if let` is cleaner for this use case and in addition allows various
failure options to be specified:

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    // All have type `Option<i32>`
    let number = Some(7);
    let letter: Option<i32> = None;
    let emoticon: Option<i32> = None;

    // The `if let` construct reads: "if `let` destructures `number` into
    // `Some(i)`, evaluate the block (`{}`).
    if let Some(i) = number {
        println!("Matched {:?}!", i);
    }

    // If you need to specify a failure, use an else:
    if let Some(i) = letter {
        println!("Matched {:?}!", i);
    } else {
        // Destructure failed. Change to the failure case.
        println!("Didn't match a number. Let's go with a letter!");
    }

    // Provide an altered failing condition.
    let i_like_letters = false;

    if let Some(i) = emoticon {
        println!("Matched {:?}!", i);
    // Destructure failed. Evaluate an `else if` condition to see if the
    // alternate failure branch should be taken:
    } else if i_like_letters {
        println!("Didn't match a number. Let's go with a letter!");
    } else {
        // The condition evaluated false. This branch is the default:
        println!("I don't like letters. Let's go with an emoticon :)!");
    }
}
```

In the same way, `if let` can be used to match any enum value:

```rust,editable
// Our example enum
enum Foo {
    Bar,
    Baz,
    Qux(u32)
}

fn main() {
    // Create example variables
    let a = Foo::Bar;
    let b = Foo::Baz;
    let c = Foo::Qux(100);

    // Variable a matches Foo::Bar
    if let Foo::Bar = a {
        println!("a is foobar");
    }

    // Variable b does not match Foo::Bar
    // So this will print nothing
    if let Foo::Bar = b {
        println!("b is foobar");
    }

    // Variable c matches Foo::Qux which has a value
    // Similar to Some() in the previous example
    if let Foo::Qux(value) = c {
        println!("c is {}", value);
    }

    // Binding also works with `if let`
    if let Foo::Qux(value @ 100) = c {
        println!("c is one hundred");
    }
}
```

Another benefit is that `if let` allows us to match non-parameterized enum variants. This is true even in cases where the enum doesn't implement or derive `PartialEq`. In such cases `if Foo::Bar == a` would fail to compile, because instances of the enum cannot be equated, however `if let` will continue to work.

Would you like a challenge? Fix the following example to use `if let`:

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
// This enum purposely neither implements nor derives PartialEq.
// That is why comparing Foo::Bar == a fails below.
enum Foo {Bar}

fn main() {
    let a = Foo::Bar;

    // Variable a matches Foo::Bar
    if Foo::Bar == a {
    // ^-- this causes a compile-time error. Use `if let` instead.
        println!("a is foobar");
    }
}
```

# let-else

With `let`-`else`, a refutable pattern can match and bind variables
in the surrounding scope like a normal `let`, or else diverge (e.g. `break`,
`return`, `panic!`) when the pattern doesn't match.

```rust
use std::str::FromStr;

fn get_count_item(s: &str) -> (u64, &str) {
    let mut it = s.split(' ');
    let (Some(count_str), Some(item)) = (it.next(), it.next()) else {
        panic!("Can't segment count item pair: '{s}'");
    };
    let Ok(count) = u64::from_str(count_str) else {
        panic!("Can't parse integer: '{count_str}'");
    };
    (count, item)
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(get_count_item("3 chairs"), (3, "chairs"));
}
```

The scope of name bindings is the main thing that makes this different from
`match` or `if let`-`else` expressions. You could previously approximate these
patterns with an unfortunate bit of repetition and an outer `let`:

```rust
# use std::str::FromStr;
#
# fn get_count_item(s: &str) -> (u64, &str) {
#     let mut it = s.split(' ');
    let (count_str, item) = match (it.next(), it.next()) {
        (Some(count_str), Some(item)) => (count_str, item),
        _ => panic!("Can't segment count item pair: '{s}'"),
    };
    let count = if let Ok(count) = u64::from_str(count_str) {
        count
    } else {
        panic!("Can't parse integer: '{count_str}'");
    };
#     (count, item)
# }
#
# assert_eq!(get_count_item("3 chairs"), (3, "chairs"));

# loop

Rust provides a `loop` keyword to indicate an infinite loop.

The `break` statement can be used to exit a loop at anytime, whereas the
`continue` statement can be used to skip the rest of the iteration and start a
new one.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0u32;

    println!("Let's count until infinity!");

    // Infinite loop
    loop {
        count += 1;

        if count == 3 {
            println!("three");

            // Skip the rest of this iteration
            continue;
        }

        println!("{}", count);

        if count == 5 {
            println!("OK, that's enough");

            // Exit this loop
            break;
        }
    }
}
```



================================================
FILE: src/flow_control/match.md
================================================
# match

Rust provides pattern matching via the `match` keyword, which can be used like
a C `switch`. The first matching arm is evaluated and all possible values must be
covered.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let number = 13;
    // TODO ^ Try different values for `number`

    println!("Tell me about {}", number);
    match number {
        // Match a single value
        1 => println!("One!"),
        // Match several values
        2 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 11 => println!("This is a prime"),
        // TODO ^ Try adding 13 to the list of prime values
        // Match an inclusive range

# while

The `while` keyword can be used to run a loop while a condition is true.

Let's write the infamous [FizzBuzz][fizzbuzz] using a `while` loop.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    // A counter variable
    let mut n = 1;

    // Loop while `n` is less than 101
    while n < 101 {
        if n % 15 == 0 {
            println!("fizzbuzz");
        } else if n % 3 == 0 {
            println!("fizz");
        } else if n % 5 == 0 {
            println!("buzz");
        } else {
            println!("{}", n);
        }

        // Increment counter
        n += 1;
    }
}
```

# while let

Similar to `if let`, `while let` can make awkward `match` sequences
more tolerable. Consider the following sequence that increments `i`:

```rust
// Make `optional` of type `Option<i32>`
let mut optional = Some(0);

// Repeatedly try this test.
loop {
    match optional {
        // If `optional` destructures, evaluate the block.
        Some(i) => {
            if i > 9 {
                println!("Greater than 9, quit!");
                optional = None;
            } else {
                println!("`i` is `{:?}`. Try again.", i);
                optional = Some(i + 1);
            }
            // ^ Requires 3 indentations!
        },
        // Quit the loop when the destructure fails:
        _ => { break; }
        // ^ Why should this be required? There must be a better way!
    }
}
```

Using `while let` makes this sequence much nicer:

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    // Make `optional` of type `Option<i32>`
    let mut optional = Some(0);

    // This reads: "while `let` destructures `optional` into
    // `Some(i)`, evaluate the block (`{}`). Else `break`.
    while let Some(i) = optional {
        if i > 9 {
            println!("Greater than 9, quit!");
            optional = None;
        } else {
            println!("`i` is `{:?}`. Try again.", i);
            optional = Some(i + 1);
        }
        // ^ Less rightward drift and doesn't require
        // explicitly handling the failing case.
    }
    // ^ `if let` had additional optional `else`/`else if`
    // clauses. `while let` does not have these.
}
```

# Nesting and labels

It's possible to `break` or `continue` outer loops when dealing with nested
loops. In these cases, the loops must be annotated with some `'label`, and the
label must be passed to the `break`/`continue` statement.

```rust,editable
#![allow(unreachable_code, unused_labels)]

fn main() {
    'outer: loop {
        println!("Entered the outer loop");

        'inner: loop {
            println!("Entered the inner loop");

            // This would break only the inner loop
            //break;

            // This breaks the outer loop
            break 'outer;
        }

        println!("This point will never be reached");
    }

    println!("Exited the outer loop");
}
```

# Returning from loops

One of the uses of a `loop` is to retry an operation until it succeeds. If the
operation returns a value though, you might need to pass it to the rest of the
code: put it after the `break`, and it will be returned by the `loop`
expression.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    assert_eq!(result, 20);
}
```



================================================
FILE: src/flow_control/match/binding.md
================================================
# Binding

Indirectly accessing a variable makes it impossible to branch and use that
variable without re-binding. `match` provides the `@` sigil for binding values to
names:

```rust,editable
// A function `age` which returns a `u32`.
fn age() -> u32 {
    15
}

fn main() {
    println!("Tell me what type of person you are");

    match age() {
        0             => println!("I haven't celebrated my first birthday yet"),
        // Could `match` 1 ..= 12 directly but then what age
        // would the child be?
        // Could `match` n and use an `if` guard, but would
        // not contribute to exhaustiveness checks.
        // (Although in this case that would not matter since
        // a "catch-all" pattern is present at the bottom)
        // Instead, bind to `n` for the sequence of 1 ..= 12.
        // Now the age can be reported.
        n @ 1  ..= 12 => println!("I'm a child of age {:?}", n),
        n @ 13 ..= 19 => println!("I'm a teen of age {:?}", n),
        // Nothing bound. Return the result.
        n             => println!("I'm an old person of age {:?}", n),
    }
}
```

You can also use binding to "destructure" `enum` variants, such as `Option`:

```rust,editable
fn some_number() -> Option<u32> {
    Some(42)
}

fn main() {
    match some_number() {
        // Got `Some` variant, match if its value, bound to `n`,
        // is equal to 42.
        // Could also use `Some(42)` and print `"The Awnser: 42!"`
        // but that would require changing `42` in 2 spots should
        // you ever wish to change it.
        // Could also use `Some(n) if n == 42` and print `"The Awnser: {n}!"`
        // but that would not contribute to exhaustiveness checks.
        // (Although in this case that would not matter since
        // the next arm is a "catch-all" pattern)
        Some(n @ 42) => println!("The Answer: {}!", n),
        // Match any other number.
        Some(n)      => println!("Not interesting... {}", n),
        // Match anything else (`None` variant).
        _            => (),
    }
}
```

# Guards

A `match` *guard* can be added to filter the arm.

```rust,editable
#[allow(dead_code)]
enum Temperature {
    Celsius(i32),
    Fahrenheit(i32),
}

fn main() {
    let temperature = Temperature::Celsius(35);
    // ^ TODO try different values for `temperature`

    match temperature {
        Temperature::Celsius(t) if t > 30 => println!("{}C is above 30 Celsius", t),
        // The `if condition` part ^ is a guard
        Temperature::Celsius(t) => println!("{}C is equal to or below 30 Celsius", t),

        Temperature::Fahrenheit(t) if t > 86 => println!("{}F is above 86 Fahrenheit", t),
        Temperature::Fahrenheit(t) => println!("{}F is equal to or below 86 Fahrenheit", t),
    }
}
```

Note that the compiler won't take guard conditions into account when checking
if all patterns are covered by the match expression.

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
fn main() {
    let number: u8 = 4;

    match number {
        i if i == 0 => println!("Zero"),
        i if i > 0 => println!("Greater than zero"),

# pointers/ref

For pointers, a distinction needs to be made between destructuring
and dereferencing as they are different concepts which are used
differently from languages like C/C++.

* Dereferencing uses `*`
* Destructuring uses `&`, `ref`, and `ref mut`

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    // Assign a reference of type `i32`. The `&` signifies there
    // is a reference being assigned.
    let reference = &4;

    match reference {
        // If `reference` is pattern matched against `&val`, it results
        // in a comparison like:
        // `&i32`
        // `&val`
        // ^ We see that if the matching `&`s are dropped, then the `i32`
        // should be assigned to `val`.
        &val => println!("Got a value via destructuring: {:?}", val),
    }

    // To avoid the `&`, you dereference before matching.
    match *reference {
        val => println!("Got a value via dereferencing: {:?}", val),
    }

    // What if you don't start with a reference? `reference` was a `&`
    // because the right side was already a reference. This is not
    // a reference because the right side is not one.
    let _not_a_reference = 3;

    // Rust provides `ref` for exactly this purpose. It modifies the
    // assignment so that a reference is created for the element; this
    // reference is assigned.
    let ref _is_a_reference = 3;

    // Accordingly, by defining 2 values without references, references
    // can be retrieved via `ref` and `ref mut`.
    let value = 5;
    let mut mut_value = 6;

    // Use `ref` keyword to create a reference.
    match value {
        ref r => println!("Got a reference to a value: {:?}", r),
    }

    // Use `ref mut` similarly.
    match mut_value {
        ref mut m => {
            // Got a reference. Gotta dereference it before we can
            // add anything to it.
            *m += 10;
            println!("We added 10. `mut_value`: {:?}", m);
        },
    }
}

    let array = [1, -2, 6];

    match array {
        // Binds the second and the third elements to the respective variables
        [0, second, third] =>
            println!("array[0] = 0, array[1] = {}, array[2] = {}", second, third),

        // Single values can be ignored with _
        [1, _, third] => println!(
            "array[0] = 1, array[2] = {} and array[1] was ignored",
            third
        ),

        // You can also bind some and ignore the rest
        [-1, second, ..] => println!(
            "array[0] = -1, array[1] = {} and all the other ones were ignored",
            second
        ),
        // The code below would not compile
        // [-1, second] => ...

        // Or store them in another array/slice (the type depends on
        // that of the value that is being matched against)
        [3, second, tail @ ..] => println!(
            "array[0] = 3, array[1] = {} and the other elements were {:?}",
            second, tail
        ),

        // Combining these patterns, we can, for example, bind the first and
        // last values, and store the rest of them in a single array
        [first, middle @ .., last] => println!(
            "array[0] = {}, middle = {:?}, array[2] = {}",
            first, middle, last
        ),

# structs

Similarly, a `struct` can be destructured as shown:

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    struct Foo {
        x: (u32, u32),
        y: u32,
    }

    // Try changing the values in the struct to see what happens
    let foo = Foo { x: (1, 2), y: 3 };

    match foo {
        Foo { x: (1, b), y } => println!("First of x is 1, b = {},  y = {} ", b, y),

        // you can destructure structs and rename the variables,
        // the order is not important
        Foo { y: 2, x: i } => println!("y is 2, i = {:?}", i),

        // and you can also ignore some variables:
        Foo { y, .. } => println!("y = {}, we don't care about x", y),
        // this will give an error: pattern does not mention field `x`
        //Foo { y } => println!("y = {}", y),
    }

    let faa = Foo { x: (1, 2), y: 3 };

    // You do not need a match block to destructure structs:
    let Foo { x : x0, y: y0 } = faa;
    println!("Outside: x0 = {x0:?}, y0 = {y0}");

    // Destructuring works with nested structs as well:
    struct Bar {
        foo: Foo,
    }

    let bar = Bar { foo: faa };
    let Bar { foo: Foo { x: nested_x, y: nested_y } } = bar;

FILE: src/fn/closures.md
================================================
# Closures

Closures are functions that can capture the enclosing environment. For
example, a closure that captures the `x` variable:

```Rust
|val| val + x
```

The syntax and capabilities of closures make them very convenient for
on the fly usage. Calling a closure is exactly like calling a function.
However, both input and return types *can* be inferred and input
variable names *must* be specified.

Other characteristics of closures include:

* using `||` instead of `()` around input variables.
* optional body delimitation (`{}`) for a single line expression (mandatory otherwise).
* the ability to capture the outer environment variables.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let outer_var = 42;

    // A regular function can't refer to variables in the enclosing environment
    //fn function(i: i32) -> i32 { i + outer_var }
    // TODO: uncomment the line above and see the compiler error. The compiler
    // suggests that we define a closure instead.

    // Closures are anonymous, here we are binding them to references.
    // Annotation is identical to function annotation but is optional
    // as are the `{}` wrapping the body. These nameless functions
    // are assigned to appropriately named variables.
    let closure_annotated = |i: i32| -> i32 { i + outer_var };
    let closure_inferred  = |i     |          i + outer_var  ;

    // Call the closures.
    println!("closure_annotated: {}", closure_annotated(1));
    println!("closure_inferred: {}", closure_inferred(1));
    // Once closure's type has been inferred, it cannot be inferred again with another type.
    //println!("cannot reuse closure_inferred with another type: {}", closure_inferred(42i64));
    // TODO: uncomment the line above and see the compiler error.

    // A closure taking no arguments which returns an `i32`.
    // The return type is inferred.
    let one = || 1;
    println!("closure returning one: {}", one());

}
```



================================================
FILE: src/fn/diverging.md
================================================
# Diverging functions

Diverging functions never return. They are marked using `!`, which is an empty type.

```rust
fn foo() -> ! {
    panic!("This call never returns.");
}
```

As opposed to all the other types, this one cannot be instantiated, because the
set of all possible values this type can have is empty. Note that, it is
different from the `()` type, which has exactly one possible value.

For example, this function returns as usual, although there is no information
in the return value.

```rust
fn some_fn() {
    ()
}

fn main() {
    let _a: () = some_fn();
    println!("This function returns and you can see this line.");
}
```

As opposed to this function, which will never return the control back to the caller.

```rust,ignore
#![feature(never_type)]

fn main() {
    let x: ! = panic!("This call never returns.");
    println!("You will never see this line!");
}
```

Although this might seem like an abstract concept, it is actually very useful and
often handy. The main advantage of this type is that it can be cast to any other
type, making it versatile in situations where an exact type is required, such as
in match branches. This flexibility allows us to write code like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    fn sum_odd_numbers(up_to: u32) -> u32 {
        let mut acc = 0;
        for i in 0..up_to {
            // Notice that the return type of this match expression must be u32
            // because of the type of the "addition" variable.
            let addition: u32 = match i%2 == 1 {
                // The "i" variable is of type u32, which is perfectly fine.
                true => i,
                // On the other hand, the "continue" expression does not return
                // u32, but it is still fine, because it never returns and therefore
                // does not violate the type requirements of the match expression.
                false => continue,
            };
            acc += addition;
        }
        acc
    }
    println!("Sum of odd numbers up to 9 (excluding): {}", sum_odd_numbers(9));
}
```

It is also the return type of functions that loop forever (e.g. `loop {}`) like
network servers or functions that terminate the process (e.g. `exit()`).

# Higher Order Functions

Rust provides Higher Order Functions (HOF). These are functions that
take one or more functions and/or produce a more useful function. HOFs
and lazy iterators give Rust its functional flavor.

```rust,editable
fn is_odd(n: u32) -> bool {
    n % 2 == 1
}

fn main() {
    println!("Find the sum of all the numbers with odd squares under 1000");
    let upper = 1000;

    // Imperative approach
    // Declare accumulator variable
    let mut acc = 0;
    // Iterate: 0, 1, 2, ... to infinity
    for n in 0.. {
        // Square the number
        let n_squared = n * n;

        if n_squared >= upper {
            // Break loop if exceeded the upper limit
            break;
        } else if is_odd(n_squared) {
            // Accumulate value, if it's odd
            acc += n_squared;
        }
    }
    println!("imperative style: {}", acc);

    // Functional approach
    let sum_of_squared_odd_numbers: u32 =
        (0..).map(|n| n * n)                             // All natural numbers squared
             .take_while(|&n_squared| n_squared < upper) // Below upper limit
             .filter(|&n_squared| is_odd(n_squared))     // That are odd
             .sum();                                     // Sum them
    println!("functional style: {}", sum_of_squared_odd_numbers);
}
```

# Associated functions & Methods

Some functions are connected to a particular type. These come in two forms:
associated functions, and methods. Associated functions are functions that
are defined on a type generally, while methods are associated functions that are
called on a particular instance of a type.

```rust,editable
struct Point {

impl Point {
    // This is an "associated function" because this function is associated with
    // a particular type, that is, Point.

FILE: src/fn/closures/anonymity.md
================================================
# Type anonymity

Closures succinctly capture variables from enclosing scopes. Does this have
any consequences? It surely does. Observe how using a closure as a function
parameter requires [generics], which is necessary because of how they are
defined:

```rust
// `F` must be generic.
fn apply<F>(f: F) where
    F: FnOnce() {
    f();
}
```

When a closure is defined, the compiler implicitly creates a new
anonymous structure to store the captured variables inside, meanwhile
implementing the functionality via one of the `traits`: `Fn`, `FnMut`, or
`FnOnce` for this unknown type. This type is assigned to the variable which
is stored until calling.

Since this new type is of unknown type, any usage in a function will require
generics. However, an unbounded type parameter `<T>` would still be ambiguous
and not be allowed. Thus, bounding by one of the `traits`: `Fn`, `FnMut`, or
`FnOnce` (which it implements) is sufficient to specify its type.

```rust,editable
// `F` must implement `Fn` for a closure which takes no
// inputs and returns nothing - exactly what is required
// for `print`.
fn apply<F>(f: F) where
    F: Fn() {
    f();
}

fn main() {
    let x = 7;

    // Capture `x` into an anonymous type and implement
    // `Fn` for it. Store it in `print`.
    let print = || println!("{}", x);

    apply(print);
}
```

FILE: src/fn/closures/capture.md
================================================
# Capturing

Closures are inherently flexible and will do what the functionality requires
to make the closure work without annotation. This allows capturing to
flexibly adapt to the use case, sometimes moving and sometimes borrowing.
Closures can capture variables:

* by reference: `&T`
* by mutable reference: `&mut T`
* by value: `T`

They preferentially capture variables by reference and only go lower when
required.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    use std::mem;

    let color = String::from("green");

    // A closure to print `color` which immediately borrows (`&`) `color` and
    // stores the borrow and closure in the `print` variable. It will remain
    // borrowed until `print` is used the last time.
    //
    // `println!` only requires arguments by immutable reference so it doesn't
    // impose anything more restrictive.
    let print = || println!("`color`: {}", color);

    // Call the closure using the borrow.
    print();

    // `color` can be borrowed immutably again, because the closure only holds
    // an immutable reference to `color`.
    let _reborrow = &color;
    print();

    // A move or reborrow is allowed after the final use of `print`
    let _color_moved = color;


    let mut count = 0;
    // A closure to increment `count` could take either `&mut count` or `count`
    // but `&mut count` is less restrictive so it takes that. Immediately
    // borrows `count`.
    //
    // A `mut` is required on `inc` because a `&mut` is stored inside. Thus,
    // calling the closure mutates `count` which requires a `mut`.
    let mut inc = || {
        count += 1;
        println!("`count`: {}", count);
    };

    // Call the closure using a mutable borrow.
    inc();

    // The closure still mutably borrows `count` because it is called later.
    // An attempt to reborrow will lead to an error.
    // let _reborrow = &count;
    // ^ TODO: try uncommenting this line.
    inc();

    // The closure no longer needs to borrow `&mut count`. Therefore, it is
    // possible to reborrow without an error
    let _count_reborrowed = &mut count;


    // A non-copy type.
    let movable = Box::new(3);

    // `mem::drop` requires `T` so this must take by value. A copy type
    // would copy into the closure leaving the original untouched.
    // A non-copy must move and so `movable` immediately moves into
    // the closure.
    let consume = || {
        println!("`movable`: {:?}", movable);
        mem::drop(movable);
    };

    // `consume` consumes the variable so this can only be called once.
    consume();
    // consume();
    // ^ TODO: Try uncommenting this line.
}
```

Using `move` before vertical pipes forces closure
to take ownership of captured variables:

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    // `Vec` has non-copy semantics.
    let haystack = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let contains = move |needle| haystack.contains(needle);

    println!("{}", contains(&1));
    println!("{}", contains(&4));

    // println!("There're {} elements in vec", haystack.len());
    // ^ Uncommenting above line will result in compile-time error
    // because borrow checker doesn't allow re-using variable after it
    // has been moved.

    // Removing `move` from closure's signature will cause closure
    // to borrow _haystack_ variable immutably, hence _haystack_ is still
    // available and uncommenting above line will not cause an error.
}
```

================================================
# Input functions

Since closures may be used as arguments, you might wonder if the same can be said
about functions. And indeed they can! If you declare a function that takes a
closure as parameter, then any function that satisfies the trait bound of that
closure can be passed as a parameter.

```rust,editable
// Define a function which takes a generic `F` argument
// bounded by `Fn`, and calls it
fn call_me<F: Fn()>(f: F) {
    f();
}

// Define a wrapper function satisfying the `Fn` bound
fn function() {
    println!("I'm a function!");
}

fn main() {
    // Define a closure satisfying the `Fn` bound
    let closure = || println!("I'm a closure!");

    call_me(closure);
    call_me(function);
}
```

As an additional note, the `Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce` `traits` dictate how
a closure captures variables from the enclosing scope.

================================================
# As input parameters

While Rust chooses how to capture variables on the fly mostly without type
annotation, this ambiguity is not allowed when writing functions. When
taking a closure as an input parameter, the closure's complete type must be
annotated using one of a few `traits`, and they're determined by what the
closure does with captured value. In order of decreasing restriction,
they are:

* `Fn`: the closure uses the captured value by reference (`&T`)
* `FnMut`: the closure uses the captured value by mutable reference (`&mut T`)
* `FnOnce`: the closure uses the captured value by value (`T`)

On a variable-by-variable basis, the compiler will capture variables in the
least restrictive manner possible.

For instance, consider a parameter annotated as `FnOnce`. This specifies
that the closure *may* capture by `&T`, `&mut T`, or `T`, but the compiler
will ultimately choose based on how the captured variables are used in the
closure.

This is because if a move is possible, then any type of borrow should also
be possible. Note that the reverse is not true. If the parameter is
annotated as `Fn`, then capturing variables by `&mut T` or `T` are not
allowed. However, `&T` is allowed.

In the following example, try swapping the usage of `Fn`, `FnMut`, and
`FnOnce` to see what happens:

```rust,editable
// A function which takes a closure as an argument and calls it.
// <F> denotes that F is a "Generic type parameter"
fn apply<F>(f: F) where
    // The closure takes no input and returns nothing.
    F: FnOnce() {
    // ^ TODO: Try changing this to `Fn` or `FnMut`.

    f();
}

// A function which takes a closure and returns an `i32`.
fn apply_to_3<F>(f: F) -> i32 where
    // The closure takes an `i32` and returns an `i32`.
    F: Fn(i32) -> i32 {

    f(3)
}

fn main() {
    use std::mem;

    let greeting = "hello";
    // A non-copy type.
    // `to_owned` creates owned data from borrowed one
    let mut farewell = "goodbye".to_owned();

    // Capture 2 variables: `greeting` by reference and
    // `farewell` by value.
    let diary = || {
        // `greeting` is by reference: requires `Fn`.
        println!("I said {}.", greeting);

        // Mutation forces `farewell` to be captured by
        // mutable reference. Now requires `FnMut`.
        farewell.push_str("!!!");
        println!("Then I screamed {}.", farewell);
        println!("Now I can sleep. zzzzz");

        // Manually calling drop forces `farewell` to
        // be captured by value. Now requires `FnOnce`.
        mem::drop(farewell);
    };

    // Call the function which applies the closure.
    apply(diary);

    // `double` satisfies `apply_to_3`'s trait bound
    let double = |x| 2 * x;

    println!("3 doubled: {}", apply_to_3(double));
}
```

FILE: src/fn/closures/output_parameters.md
================================================
# As output parameters

Closures as input parameters are possible, so returning closures as
output parameters should also be possible. However, anonymous
closure types are, by definition, unknown, so we have to use
`impl Trait` to return them.

The valid traits for returning a closure are:

* `Fn`
* `FnMut`
* `FnOnce`

Beyond this, the `move` keyword must be used, which signals that all captures
occur by value. This is required because any captures by reference would be
dropped as soon as the function exited, leaving invalid references in the
closure.

```rust,editable
fn create_fn() -> impl Fn() {
    let text = "Fn".to_owned();

    move || println!("This is a: {}", text)
}

fn create_fnmut() -> impl FnMut() {
    let text = "FnMut".to_owned();

    move || println!("This is a: {}", text)
}

fn create_fnonce() -> impl FnOnce() {
    let text = "FnOnce".to_owned();

    move || println!("This is a: {}", text)
}

fn main() {
    let fn_plain = create_fn();
    let mut fn_mut = create_fnmut();
    let fn_once = create_fnonce();

    fn_plain();
    fn_mut();
    fn_once();

================================================
# Searching through iterators

`Iterator::find` is a function which iterates over an iterator and searches for the
first value which satisfies some condition. If none of the values satisfy the
condition, it returns `None`. Its signature:

```rust,ignore
pub trait Iterator {
    // The type being iterated over.
    type Item;

    // `find` takes `&mut self` meaning the caller may be borrowed
    // and modified, but not consumed.
    fn find<P>(&mut self, predicate: P) -> Option<Self::Item> where
        // `FnMut` meaning any captured variable may at most be
        // modified, not consumed. `&Self::Item` states it takes
        // arguments to the closure by reference.
        P: FnMut(&Self::Item) -> bool;
}
```

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let vec1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let vec2 = vec![4, 5, 6];

    // `iter()` for vecs yields `&i32`.
    let mut iter = vec1.iter();
    // `into_iter()` for vecs yields `i32`.
    let mut into_iter = vec2.into_iter();

    // `iter()` for vecs yields `&i32`, and we want to reference one of its
    // items, so we have to destructure `&&i32` to `i32`
    println!("Find 2 in vec1: {:?}", iter     .find(|&&x| x == 2));
    // `into_iter()` for vecs yields `i32`, and we want to reference one of
    // its items, so we have to destructure `&i32` to `i32`
    println!("Find 2 in vec2: {:?}", into_iter.find(| &x| x == 2));

    let array1 = [1, 2, 3];
    let array2 = [4, 5, 6];

    // `iter()` for arrays yields `&&i32`
    println!("Find 2 in array1: {:?}", array1.iter()     .find(|&&x| x == 2));
    // `into_iter()` for arrays yields `&i32`
    println!("Find 2 in array2: {:?}", array2.into_iter().find(|&x| x == 2));
}
```

`Iterator::find` gives you a reference to the item. But if you want the _index_ of the
item, use `Iterator::position`.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let vec = vec![1, 9, 3, 3, 13, 2];

    // `iter()` for vecs yields `&i32` and `position()` does not take a reference, so
    // we have to destructure `&i32` to `i32`
    let index_of_first_even_number = vec.iter().position(|&x| x % 2 == 0);
    assert_eq!(index_of_first_even_number, Some(5));

    // `into_iter()` for vecs yields `i32` and `position()` does not take a reference, so
    // we do not have to destructure
    let index_of_first_negative_number = vec.into_iter().position(|x| x < 0);
    assert_eq!(index_of_first_negative_number, None);
}
```

# Associated items

"Associated Items" refers to a set of rules pertaining to [`item`][items]s

`trait`s to internally define new items.

One such item is called an *associated type*, providing simpler usage

# Bounds

When working with generics, the type parameters often must use traits as *bounds* to
stipulate what functionality a type implements. For example, the following
example uses the trait `Display` to print and so it requires `T` to be bound
by `Display`; that is, `T` *must* implement `Display`.

```rust,ignore
// Define a function `printer` that takes a generic type `T` which
// must implement trait `Display`.
fn printer<T: Display>(t: T) {
    println!("{}", t);
}
```

Bounding restricts the generic to types that conform to the bounds. That is:

```rust,ignore
struct S<T: Display>(T);

// Error! `Vec<T>` does not implement `Display`. This
// specialization will fail.
let s = S(vec![1]);
```

Another effect of bounding is that generic instances are allowed to access the
[methods] of traits specified in the bounds. For example:

```rust,editable
// A trait which implements the print marker: `{:?}`.
use std::fmt::Debug;

trait HasArea {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

impl HasArea for Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 { self.length * self.height }
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle { length: f64, height: f64 }
#[allow(dead_code)]
struct Triangle  { length: f64, height: f64 }

// The generic `T` must implement `Debug`. Regardless
// of the type, this will work properly.
fn print_debug<T: Debug>(t: &T) {
    println!("{:?}", t);
}

// `T` must implement `HasArea`. Any type which meets
// the bound can access `HasArea`'s function `area`.
fn area<T: HasArea>(t: &T) -> f64 { t.area() }

fn main() {
    let rectangle = Rectangle { length: 3.0, height: 4.0 };
    let _triangle = Triangle  { length: 3.0, height: 4.0 };

    print_debug(&rectangle);
    println!("Area: {}", area(&rectangle));

    //print_debug(&_triangle);
    //println!("Area: {}", area(&_triangle));
    // ^ TODO: Try uncommenting these.
    // | Error: Does not implement either `Debug` or `HasArea`.
}
```

As an additional note, [`where`][where] clauses can also be used to apply bounds in
some cases to be more expressive.

# Functions

The same set of rules can be applied to functions: a type `T` becomes
generic when preceded by `<T>`.

Using generic functions sometimes requires explicitly specifying type
parameters. This may be the case if the function is called where the return type
is generic, or if the compiler doesn't have enough information to infer
the necessary type parameters.

A function call with explicitly specified type parameters looks like:
`fun::<A, B, ...>()`.

```rust,editable
struct A;          // Concrete type `A`.
struct S(A);       // Concrete type `S`.
struct SGen<T>(T); // Generic type `SGen`.

// The following functions all take ownership of the variable passed into
// them and immediately go out of scope, freeing the variable.

// Define a function `reg_fn` that takes an argument `_s` of type `S`.
// This has no `<T>` so this is not a generic function.
fn reg_fn(_s: S) {}

// Define a function `gen_spec_t` that takes an argument `_s` of type `SGen<T>`.
// It has been explicitly given the type parameter `A`, but because `A` has not
// been specified as a generic type parameter for `gen_spec_t`, it is not generic.
fn gen_spec_t(_s: SGen<A>) {}

// Define a function `gen_spec_i32` that takes an argument `_s` of type `SGen<i32>`.
// It has been explicitly given the type parameter `i32`, which is a specific type.
// Because `i32` is not a generic type, this function is also not generic.
fn gen_spec_i32(_s: SGen<i32>) {}

// Define a function `generic` that takes an argument `_s` of type `SGen<T>`.
// Because `SGen<T>` is preceded by `<T>`, this function is generic over `T`.
fn generic<T>(_s: SGen<T>) {}

fn main() {
    // Using the non-generic functions
    reg_fn(S(A));          // Concrete type.
    gen_spec_t(SGen(A));   // Implicitly specified type parameter `A`.
    gen_spec_i32(SGen(6)); // Implicitly specified type parameter `i32`.

    // Explicitly specified type parameter `char` to `generic()`.
    generic::<char>(SGen('a'));

    // Implicitly specified type parameter `char` to `generic()`.
    generic(SGen('c'));
}
```

# Traits

Of course `trait`s can also be generic. Here we define one which reimplements
the `Drop` `trait` as a generic method to `drop` itself and an input.

```rust,editable
// Non-copyable types.
struct Empty;
struct Null;

// A trait generic over `T`.
trait DoubleDrop<T> {
    // Define a method on the caller type which takes an
    // additional single parameter `T` and does nothing with it.
    fn double_drop(self, _: T);
}

// Implement `DoubleDrop<T>` for any generic parameter `T` and
// caller `U`.
impl<T, U> DoubleDrop<T> for U {
    // This method takes ownership of both passed arguments,
    // deallocating both.
    fn double_drop(self, _: T) {}
}

fn main() {
    let empty = Empty;
    let null  = Null;

    // Deallocate `empty` and `null`.
    empty.double_drop(null);

    //empty;
    //null;
    // ^ TODO: Try uncommenting these lines.
}
```

# Implementation

Similar to functions, implementations require care to remain generic.

```rust
struct S; // Concrete type `S`
struct GenericVal<T>(T); // Generic type `GenericVal`

// impl of GenericVal where we explicitly specify type parameters:
impl GenericVal<f32> {} // Specify `f32`
impl GenericVal<S> {} // Specify `S` as defined above

// `<T>` Must precede the type to remain generic
impl<T> GenericVal<T> {}
```

```rust,editable
struct Val {
    val: f64,
}

struct GenVal<T> {
    gen_val: T,
}

// impl of Val
impl Val {
    fn value(&self) -> &f64 {
        &self.val
    }
}

// impl of GenVal for a generic type `T`
impl<T> GenVal<T> {
    fn value(&self) -> &T {
        &self.gen_val
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = Val { val: 3.0 };
    let y = GenVal { gen_val: 3i32 };

    println!("{}, {}", x.value(), y.value());
}
```

# Multiple bounds

Multiple bounds for a single type can be applied with a `+`. Like normal, different types are
separated with `,`.

```rust,editable
use std::fmt::{Debug, Display};

fn compare_prints<T: Debug + Display>(t: &T) {
    println!("Debug: `{:?}`", t);
    println!("Display: `{}`", t);
}

fn compare_types<T: Debug, U: Debug>(t: &T, u: &U) {
    println!("t: `{:?}`", t);
    println!("u: `{:?}`", u);
}

fn main() {
    let string = "words";
    let array = [1, 2, 3];
    let vec = vec![1, 2, 3];

    compare_prints(&string);
    //compare_prints(&array);
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this.

    compare_types(&array, &vec);
}
```

================================================
FILE: src/generics/new_types.md
================================================
# New Type Idiom

The `newtype` idiom gives compile time guarantees that the right type of value is supplied
to a program.

For example, an age verification function that checks age in years, *must* be given
a value of type `Years`.

```rust, editable
struct Years(i64);

struct Days(i64);

impl Years {
    pub fn to_days(&self) -> Days {
        Days(self.0 * 365)
    }
}

impl Days {
    /// truncates partial years
    pub fn to_years(&self) -> Years {
        Years(self.0 / 365)
    }
}

fn is_adult(age: &Years) -> bool {
    age.0 >= 18
}

fn main() {
    let age = Years(25);
    let age_days = age.to_days();
    println!("Is an adult? {}", is_adult(&age));
    println!("Is an adult? {}", is_adult(&age_days.to_years()));
    // println!("Is an adult? {}", is_adult(&age_days));
}
```

Uncomment the last print statement to observe that the type supplied must be `Years`.

To obtain the `newtype`'s value as the base type, you may use the tuple or destructuring syntax like so:

```rust, editable
struct Years(i64);

fn main() {
    let years = Years(42);
    let years_as_primitive_1: i64 = years.0; // Tuple
    let Years(years_as_primitive_2) = years; // Destructuring
}
```

FILE: src/generics/phantom.md
================================================
# Phantom type parameters

A phantom type parameter is one that doesn't show up at runtime,
but is checked statically (and only) at compile time.

Data types can use extra generic type parameters to act as markers
or to perform type checking at compile time. These extra parameters
hold no storage values, and have no runtime behavior.

In the following example, we combine [std::marker::PhantomData]
with the phantom type parameter concept to create tuples containing
different data types.

```rust,editable
use std::marker::PhantomData;

// A phantom tuple struct which is generic over `A` with hidden parameter `B`.
#[derive(PartialEq)] // Allow equality test for this type.
struct PhantomTuple<A, B>(A, PhantomData<B>);

// A phantom type struct which is generic over `A` with hidden parameter `B`.
#[derive(PartialEq)] // Allow equality test for this type.
struct PhantomStruct<A, B> { first: A, phantom: PhantomData<B> }

// Note: Storage is allocated for generic type `A`, but not for `B`.
//       Therefore, `B` cannot be used in computations.

fn main() {
    // Here, `f32` and `f64` are the hidden parameters.
    // PhantomTuple type specified as `<char, f32>`.
    let _tuple1: PhantomTuple<char, f32> = PhantomTuple('Q', PhantomData);
    // PhantomTuple type specified as `<char, f64>`.
    let _tuple2: PhantomTuple<char, f64> = PhantomTuple('Q', PhantomData);

    // Type specified as `<char, f32>`.
    let _struct1: PhantomStruct<char, f32> = PhantomStruct {
        first: 'Q',
        phantom: PhantomData,
    };
    // Type specified as `<char, f64>`.
    let _struct2: PhantomStruct<char, f64> = PhantomStruct {
        first: 'Q',
        phantom: PhantomData,
    };

    // Compile-time Error! Type mismatch so these cannot be compared:
    // println!("_tuple1 == _tuple2 yields: {}",
    //           _tuple1 == _tuple2);

    // Compile-time Error! Type mismatch so these cannot be compared:
    // println!("_struct1 == _struct2 yields: {}",
    //           _struct1 == _struct2);
}
```

================================================
FILE: src/generics/where.md
================================================
# Where clauses

A bound can also be expressed using a `where` clause immediately
before the opening `{`, rather than at the type's first mention.
Additionally, `where` clauses can apply bounds to arbitrary types,
rather than just to type parameters.

Some cases that a `where` clause is useful:

* When specifying generic types and bounds separately is clearer:

```rust,ignore
impl <A: TraitB + TraitC, D: TraitE + TraitF> MyTrait<A, D> for YourType {}

// Expressing bounds with a `where` clause
impl <A, D> MyTrait<A, D> for YourType where
    A: TraitB + TraitC,
    D: TraitE + TraitF {}
```

* When using a `where` clause is more expressive than using normal syntax.
The `impl` in this example cannot be directly expressed without a `where` clause:

```rust,editable
use std::fmt::Debug;

trait PrintInOption {
    fn print_in_option(self);
}

// Because we would otherwise have to express this as `T: Debug` or
// use another method of indirect approach, this requires a `where` clause:
impl<T> PrintInOption for T where
    Option<T>: Debug {
    // We want `Option<T>: Debug` as our bound because that is what's
    // being printed. Doing otherwise would be using the wrong bound.
    fn print_in_option(self) {
        println!("{:?}", Some(self));
    }
}

fn main() {
    let vec = vec![1, 2, 3];

    vec.print_in_option();
}
```

================================================
# The Problem

A `trait` that is generic over its container type has type specification
requirements - users of the `trait` *must* specify all of its generic types.

In the example below, the `Contains` `trait` allows the use of the generic
types `A` and `B`. The trait is then implemented for the `Container` type,
specifying `i32` for `A` and `B` so that it can be used with `fn difference()`.

Because `Contains` is generic, we are forced to explicitly state *all* of the
generic types for `fn difference()`. In practice, we want a way to express that
`A` and `B` are determined by the *input* `C`. As you will see in the next
section, associated types provide exactly that capability.

```rust,editable
struct Container(i32, i32);

// A trait which checks if 2 items are stored inside of container.
// Also retrieves first or last value.
trait Contains<A, B> {
    fn contains(&self, _: &A, _: &B) -> bool; // Explicitly requires `A` and `B`.
    fn first(&self) -> i32; // Doesn't explicitly require `A` or `B`.
    fn last(&self) -> i32;  // Doesn't explicitly require `A` or `B`.
}

impl Contains<i32, i32> for Container {
    // True if the numbers stored are equal.
    fn contains(&self, number_1: &i32, number_2: &i32) -> bool {
        (&self.0 == number_1) && (&self.1 == number_2)
    }

    // Grab the first number.
    fn first(&self) -> i32 { self.0 }

    // Grab the last number.
    fn last(&self) -> i32 { self.1 }
}

// `C` contains `A` and `B`. In light of that, having to express `A` and
// `B` again is a nuisance.
fn difference<A, B, C>(container: &C) -> i32 where
    C: Contains<A, B> {
    container.last() - container.first()
}

fn main() {
    let number_1 = 3;
    let number_2 = 10;

    let container = Container(number_1, number_2);

    println!("Does container contain {} and {}: {}",
        &number_1, &number_2,
        container.contains(&number_1, &number_2));
    println!("First number: {}", container.first());
    println!("Last number: {}", container.last());

    println!("The difference is: {}", difference(&container));
}
```

================================================
FILE: src/generics/assoc_items/types.md
================================================
# Associated types

The use of "Associated types" improves the overall readability of code
by moving inner types locally into a trait as *output* types. Syntax
for the `trait` definition is as follows:

```rust
// `A` and `B` are defined in the trait via the `type` keyword.
// (Note: `type` in this context is different from `type` when used for
// aliases).
trait Contains {
    type A;
    type B;

    // Updated syntax to refer to these new types generically.
    fn contains(&self, _: &Self::A, _: &Self::B) -> bool;
}
```

Note that functions that use the `trait` `Contains` are no longer required
to express `A` or `B` at all:

```rust,ignore
// Without using associated types
fn difference<A, B, C>(container: &C) -> i32 where
    C: Contains<A, B> { ... }

// Using associated types
fn difference<C: Contains>(container: &C) -> i32 { ... }
```

Let's rewrite the example from the previous section using associated types:

```rust,editable
struct Container(i32, i32);

// A trait which checks if 2 items are stored inside of container.
// Also retrieves first or last value.
trait Contains {
    // Define generic types here which methods will be able to utilize.
    type A;
    type B;

    fn contains(&self, _: &Self::A, _: &Self::B) -> bool;
    fn first(&self) -> i32;
    fn last(&self) -> i32;
}

impl Contains for Container {
    // Specify what types `A` and `B` are. If the `input` type
    // is `Container(i32, i32)`, the `output` types are determined
    // as `i32` and `i32`.
    type A = i32;
    type B = i32;

    // `&Self::A` and `&Self::B` are also valid here.
    fn contains(&self, number_1: &i32, number_2: &i32) -> bool {
        (&self.0 == number_1) && (&self.1 == number_2)
    }
    // Grab the first number.
    fn first(&self) -> i32 { self.0 }

    // Grab the last number.
    fn last(&self) -> i32 { self.1 }
}

fn difference<C: Contains>(container: &C) -> i32 {
    container.last() - container.first()
}

fn main() {
    let number_1 = 3;
    let number_2 = 10;

    let container = Container(number_1, number_2);

    println!("Does container contain {} and {}: {}",
        &number_1, &number_2,
        container.contains(&number_1, &number_2));
    println!("First number: {}", container.first());
    println!("Last number: {}", container.last());

    println!("The difference is: {}", difference(&container));
}
```

================================================
# Testcase: empty bounds

A consequence of how bounds work is that even if a `trait` doesn't
include any functionality, you can still use it as a bound. `Eq` and
`Copy` are examples of such `trait`s from the `std` library.

```rust,editable
struct Cardinal;
struct BlueJay;
struct Turkey;

trait Red {}
trait Blue {}

impl Red for Cardinal {}
impl Blue for BlueJay {}

// These functions are only valid for types which implement these
// traits. The fact that the traits are empty is irrelevant.
fn red<T: Red>(_: &T)   -> &'static str { "red" }
fn blue<T: Blue>(_: &T) -> &'static str { "blue" }

fn main() {
    let cardinal = Cardinal;
    let blue_jay = BlueJay;
    let _turkey   = Turkey;

    // `red()` won't work on a blue jay nor vice versa
    // because of the bounds.
    println!("A cardinal is {}", red(&cardinal));
    println!("A blue jay is {}", blue(&blue_jay));
    //println!("A turkey is {}", red(&_turkey));
    // ^ TODO: Try uncommenting this line.
}
```

# Testcase: unit clarification

A useful method of unit conversions can be examined by implementing `Add`
with a phantom type parameter. The `Add` `trait` is examined below:

```rust,ignore
// This construction would impose: `Self + RHS = Output`
// where RHS defaults to Self if not specified in the implementation.
pub trait Add<RHS = Self> {
    type Output;

    fn add(self, rhs: RHS) -> Self::Output;
}

// `Output` must be `T<U>` so that `T<U> + T<U> = T<U>`.
impl<U> Add for T<U> {
    type Output = T<U>;
    ...
}
```

The whole implementation:

```rust,editable
use std::ops::Add;
use std::marker::PhantomData;

/// Create void enumerations to define unit types.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
enum Inch {}
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
enum Mm {}

/// `Length` is a type with phantom type parameter `Unit`,
/// and is not generic over the length type (that is `f64`).
///
/// `f64` already implements the `Clone` and `Copy` traits.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
struct Length<Unit>(f64, PhantomData<Unit>);

/// The `Add` trait defines the behavior of the `+` operator.
impl<Unit> Add for Length<Unit> {
    type Output = Length<Unit>;

    // add() returns a new `Length` struct containing the sum.
    fn add(self, rhs: Length<Unit>) -> Length<Unit> {
        // `+` calls the `Add` implementation for `f64`.
        Length(self.0 + rhs.0, PhantomData)
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Specifies `one_foot` to have phantom type parameter `Inch`.
    let one_foot:  Length<Inch> = Length(12.0, PhantomData);
    // `one_meter` has phantom type parameter `Mm`.
    let one_meter: Length<Mm>   = Length(1000.0, PhantomData);

    // `+` calls the `add()` method we implemented for `Length<Unit>`.
    //
    // Since `Length` implements `Copy`, `add()` does not consume
    // `one_foot` and `one_meter` but copies them into `self` and `rhs`.
    let two_feet = one_foot + one_foot;
    let two_meters = one_meter + one_meter;

    // Addition works.
    println!("one foot + one_foot = {:?} in", two_feet.0);
    println!("one meter + one_meter = {:?} mm", two_meters.0);

    // Nonsensical operations fail as they should:
    // Compile-time Error: type mismatch.
    //let one_feter = one_foot + one_meter;
}
```

# Comments

Any program requires comments, and Rust supports
a few different varieties:

* *Regular comments* which are ignored by the compiler:
  * `// Line comments which go to the end of the line.`
  * `/* Block comments which go to the closing delimiter. */`
* *Doc comments* which are parsed into HTML library [documentation][docs]:
  * `/// Generate library docs for the following item.`
  * `//! Generate library docs for the enclosing item.`

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    // This is an example of a line comment.
    // There are two slashes at the beginning of the line.
    // And nothing written after these will be read by the compiler.

    // println!("Hello, world!");

    // Run it. See? Now try deleting the two slashes, and run it again.

# Formatted print

Printing is handled by a series of [`macros`][macros] defined in
[`std::fmt`][fmt] some of which are:

* `format!`: write formatted text to [`String`][string]
* `print!`: same as `format!` but the text is printed to the console
  (io::stdout).
* `println!`: same as `print!` but a newline is appended.
* `eprint!`: same as `print!` but the text is printed to the standard error
  (io::stderr).
* `eprintln!`: same as `eprint!` but a newline is appended.

All parse text in the same fashion. As a plus, Rust checks formatting
correctness at compile time.

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
fn main() {
    // In general, the `{}` will be automatically replaced with any
    // arguments. These will be stringified.
    println!("{} days", 31);

    // Positional arguments can be used. Specifying an integer inside `{}`
    // determines which additional argument will be replaced. Arguments start
    // at 0 immediately after the format string.
    println!("{0}, this is {1}. {1}, this is {0}", "Alice", "Bob");

    // As can named arguments.
    println!("{subject} {verb} {object}",
             object="the lazy dog",
             subject="the quick brown fox",
             verb="jumps over");

    // Different formatting can be invoked by specifying the format character
    // after a `:`.
    println!("Base 10:               {}",   69420); // 69420
    println!("Base 2 (binary):       {:b}", 69420); // 10000111100101100
    println!("Base 8 (octal):        {:o}", 69420); // 207454
    println!("Base 16 (hexadecimal): {:x}", 69420); // 10f2c

    // You can right-justify text with a specified width. This will
    // output "    1". (Four white spaces and a "1", for a total width of 5.)
    println!("{number:>5}", number=1);

    // You can pad numbers with extra zeroes,
    println!("{number:0>5}", number=1); // 00001
    // and left-adjust by flipping the sign. This will output "10000".
    println!("{number:0<5}", number=1); // 10000

    // You can use named arguments in the format specifier by appending a `$`.
    println!("{number:0>width$}", number=1, width=5);

    // Rust even checks to make sure the correct number of arguments are used.
    println!("My name is {0}, {1} {0}", "Bond");
    // FIXME ^ Add the missing argument: "James"

    // Only types that implement fmt::Display can be formatted with `{}`. User-
    // defined types do not implement fmt::Display by default.

    #[allow(dead_code)] // disable `dead_code` which warn against unused module
    struct Structure(i32);

    // This will not compile because `Structure` does not implement
    // fmt::Display.
    // println!("This struct `{}` won't print...", Structure(3));
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line

    // For Rust 1.58 and above, you can directly capture the argument from a
    // surrounding variable. Just like the above, this will output
    // "    1", 4 white spaces and a "1".
    let number: f64 = 1.0;
    let width: usize = 5;
    println!("{number:>width$}");
}
```

[`std::fmt`][fmt] contains many [`traits`][traits] which govern the display
of text. The base form of two important ones are listed below:

* `fmt::Debug`: Uses the `{:?}` marker. Format text for debugging purposes.
* `fmt::Display`: Uses the `{}` marker. Format text in a more elegant, user
  friendly fashion.

Here, we used `fmt::Display` because the std library provides implementations
for these types. To print text for custom types, more steps are required.

Implementing the `fmt::Display` trait automatically implements the
[`ToString`] trait which allows us to [convert] the type to [`String`][string].

In *line 43*, `#[allow(dead_code)]` is an [attribute] which only applies to the module after it.

### Activities

* Fix the issue in the above code (see FIXME) so that it runs without
  error.
* Try uncommenting the line that attempts to format the `Structure` struct
  (see TODO)
* Add a `println!` macro call that prints: `Pi is roughly 3.142` by controlling
  the number of decimal places shown. For the purposes of this exercise, use
  `let pi = 3.141592` as an estimate for pi. (Hint: you may need to check the
  [`std::fmt`][fmt] documentation for setting the number of decimals to display)

# Formatting

We've seen that formatting is specified via a *format string*:

* `format!("{}", foo)` -> `"3735928559"`
* `format!("0x{:X}", foo)` -> [`"0xDEADBEEF"`][deadbeef]
* `format!("0o{:o}", foo)` -> `"0o33653337357"`

The same variable (`foo`) can be formatted differently depending on which
*argument type* is used: `X` vs `o` vs *unspecified*.

This formatting functionality is implemented via traits, and there is one trait
for each argument type. The most common formatting trait is `Display`, which
handles cases where the argument type is left unspecified: `{}` for instance.

```rust,editable
use std::fmt::{self, Formatter, Display};

struct City {
    name: &'static str,
    // Latitude
    lat: f32,
    // Longitude
    lon: f32,
}

impl Display for City {
    // `f` is a buffer, and this method must write the formatted string into it.
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        let lat_c = if self.lat >= 0.0 { 'N' } else { 'S' };
        let lon_c = if self.lon >= 0.0 { 'E' } else { 'W' };

        // `write!` is like `format!`, but it will write the formatted string
        // into a buffer (the first argument).
        write!(f, "{}: {:.3}°{} {:.3}°{}",
               self.name, self.lat.abs(), lat_c, self.lon.abs(), lon_c)
    }
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Color {
    red: u8,
    green: u8,
    blue: u8,
}

fn main() {
    for city in [
        City { name: "Dublin", lat: 53.347778, lon: -6.259722 },
        City { name: "Oslo", lat: 59.95, lon: 10.75 },
        City { name: "Vancouver", lat: 49.25, lon: -123.1 },
    ] {
        println!("{}", city);
    }
    for color in [
        Color { red: 128, green: 255, blue: 90 },
        Color { red: 0, green: 3, blue: 254 },
        Color { red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0 },
    ] {
        // Switch this to use {} once you've added an implementation
        // for fmt::Display.
        println!("{:?}", color);
    }
}
```

You can view a [full list of formatting traits][fmt_traits] and their argument
types in the [`std::fmt`][fmt] documentation.

### Activity

Add an implementation of the `fmt::Display` trait for the `Color` struct above
so that the output displays as:

```text
RGB (128, 255, 90) 0x80FF5A
RGB (0, 3, 254) 0x0003FE
RGB (0, 0, 0) 0x000000
```

Two hints if you get stuck:

* You [may need to list each color more than once][named_parameters].
* You can [pad with zeros to a width of 2][fmt_width] with `:0>2`.
For hexadecimals, you can use `:02X`.

Bonus:

* If you would like to experiment with [type casting][type_casting] in advance,
the formula for [calculating a color in the RGB color space][rgb_color] is
`RGB = (R * 65_536) + (G * 256) + B`, where `R is RED, G is GREEN, and B is BLUE`.
An unsigned 8-bit integer (`u8`) can only hold numbers up to 255. To cast `u8` to `u32`, you can write `variable_name as u32`.

================================================
FILE: src/hello/print/print_debug.md
================================================
# Debug

All types which want to use `std::fmt` formatting `traits` require an
implementation to be printable. Automatic implementations are only provided
for types such as in the `std` library. All others *must* be manually
implemented somehow.

The `fmt::Debug` `trait` makes this very straightforward. *All* types can
`derive` (automatically create) the `fmt::Debug` implementation. This is
not true for `fmt::Display` which must be manually implemented.

```rust
// This structure cannot be printed either with `fmt::Display` or
// with `fmt::Debug`.
struct UnPrintable(i32);

// The `derive` attribute automatically creates the implementation
// required to make this `struct` printable with `fmt::Debug`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct DebugPrintable(i32);
```

All `std` library types are automatically printable with `{:?}` too:

```rust,editable
// Derive the `fmt::Debug` implementation for `Structure`. `Structure`
// is a structure which contains a single `i32`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Structure(i32);

// Put a `Structure` inside of the structure `Deep`. Make it printable
// also.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Deep(Structure);

fn main() {
    // Printing with `{:?}` is similar to with `{}`.
    println!("{:?} months in a year.", 12);
    println!("{1:?} {0:?} is the {actor:?} name.",
             "Slater",
             "Christian",
             actor="actor's");

    // `Structure` is printable!
    println!("Now {:?} will print!", Structure(3));

    // The problem with `derive` is there is no control over how
    // the results look. What if I want this to just show a `7`?
    println!("Now {:?} will print!", Deep(Structure(7)));
}
```

So `fmt::Debug` definitely makes this printable but sacrifices some elegance.
Rust also provides "pretty printing" with `{:#?}`.

```rust,editable
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person<'a> {
    name: &'a str,
    age: u8
}

fn main() {
    let name = "Peter";
    let age = 27;
    let peter = Person { name, age };

    // Pretty print
    println!("{:#?}", peter);
}
```

One can manually implement `fmt::Display` to control the display.

================================================
# Display

`fmt::Debug` hardly looks compact and clean, so it is often advantageous to
customize the output appearance. This is done by manually implementing
[`fmt::Display`][fmt], which uses the `{}` print marker. Implementing it
looks like this:

```rust
// Import (via `use`) the `fmt` module to make it available.
use std::fmt;

// Define a structure for which `fmt::Display` will be implemented. This is
// a tuple struct named `Structure` that contains an `i32`.
struct Structure(i32);

// To use the `{}` marker, the trait `fmt::Display` must be implemented
// manually for the type.
impl fmt::Display for Structure {
    // This trait requires `fmt` with this exact signature.
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        // Write strictly the first element into the supplied output
        // stream: `f`. Returns `fmt::Result` which indicates whether the
        // operation succeeded or failed. Note that `write!` uses syntax which
        // is very similar to `println!`.
        write!(f, "{}", self.0)
    }
}
```

`fmt::Display` may be cleaner than `fmt::Debug` but this presents
a problem for the `std` library. How should ambiguous types be displayed?
For example, if the `std` library implemented a single style for all
`Vec<T>`, what style should it be? Would it be either of these two?

* `Vec<path>`: `/:/etc:/home/username:/bin` (split on `:`)
* `Vec<number>`: `1,2,3` (split on `,`)

No, because there is no ideal style for all types and the `std` library
doesn't presume to dictate one. `fmt::Display` is not implemented for `Vec<T>`
or for any other generic containers. `fmt::Debug` must then be used for these
generic cases.

This is not a problem though because for any new *container* type which is
*not* generic, `fmt::Display` can be implemented.

```rust,editable
use std::fmt; // Import `fmt`

// A structure holding two numbers. `Debug` will be derived so the results can
// be contrasted with `Display`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct MinMax(i64, i64);

// Implement `Display` for `MinMax`.
impl fmt::Display for MinMax {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        // Use `self.number` to refer to each positional data point.
        write!(f, "({}, {})", self.0, self.1)
    }
}

// Define a structure where the fields are nameable for comparison.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point2D {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

// Similarly, implement `Display` for `Point2D`.
impl fmt::Display for Point2D {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        // Customize so only `x` and `y` are denoted.
        write!(f, "x: {}, y: {}", self.x, self.y)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let minmax = MinMax(0, 14);

    println!("Compare structures:");
    println!("Display: {}", minmax);
    println!("Debug: {:?}", minmax);

    let big_range =   MinMax(-300, 300);
    let small_range = MinMax(-3, 3);

    println!("The big range is {big} and the small is {small}",
             small = small_range,
             big = big_range);

    let point = Point2D { x: 3.3, y: 7.2 };

    println!("Compare points:");
    println!("Display: {}", point);
    println!("Debug: {:?}", point);

    // Error. Both `Debug` and `Display` were implemented, but `{:b}`
    // requires `fmt::Binary` to be implemented. This will not work.
    // println!("What does Point2D look like in binary: {:b}?", point);
}
```

So, `fmt::Display` has been implemented but `fmt::Binary` has not, and therefore
cannot be used. `std::fmt` has many such [`traits`][traits] and each requires
its own implementation. This is detailed further in [`std::fmt`][fmt].

### Activity

After checking the output of the above example, use the `Point2D` struct as a
guide to add a `Complex` struct to the example. When printed in the same
way, the output should be:

```txt
Display: 3.3 +7.2i
Debug: Complex { real: 3.3, imag: 7.2 }

Display: 4.7 -2.3i
Debug: Complex { real: 4.7, imag: -2.3 }
```

Bonus: Add a space before the `+`/`-` signs.

Hints in case you get stuck:

- Check the documentation for [`Sign/#/0`][fmt_sign0] in `std::fmt`.
- Bonus: Check [`if`-`else`][if_else] branching and the [`abs`][f64_abs] function.

================================================
# Testcase: List

Implementing `fmt::Display` for a structure where the elements must each be
handled sequentially is tricky. The problem is that each `write!` generates a
`fmt::Result`. Proper handling of this requires dealing with *all* the
results. Rust provides the `?` operator for exactly this purpose.

Using `?` on `write!` looks like this:

```rust,ignore
// Try `write!` to see if it errors. If it errors, return
// the error. Otherwise continue.
write!(f, "{}", value)?;
```

With `?` available, implementing `fmt::Display` for a `Vec` is
straightforward:

```rust,editable
use std::fmt; // Import the `fmt` module.

// Define a structure named `List` containing a `Vec`.
struct List(Vec<i32>);

impl fmt::Display for List {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        // Extract the value using tuple indexing,
        // and create a reference to `vec`.
        let vec = &self.0;

        write!(f, "[")?;

        // Iterate over `v` in `vec` while enumerating the iteration
        // index in `index`.
        for (index, v) in vec.iter().enumerate() {
            // For every element except the first, add a comma.
            // Use the ? operator to return on errors.
            if index != 0 { write!(f, ", ")?; }
            write!(f, "{}", v)?;
        }

        // Close the opened bracket and return a fmt::Result value.
        write!(f, "]")
    }
}

fn main() {
    let v = List(vec![1, 2, 3]);
    println!("{}", v);
}
```

### Activity

Try changing the program so that the index of each element in the vector is also
printed. The new output should look like this:

```rust,ignore
[0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3]
```

# Designators

The arguments of a macro are prefixed by a dollar sign `$` and type annotated
with a *designator*:

```rust,editable
macro_rules! create_function {
    // This macro takes an argument of designator `ident` and
    // creates a function named `$func_name`.
    // The `ident` designator is used for variable/function names.
    ($func_name:ident) => {
        fn $func_name() {
            // The `stringify!` macro converts an `ident` into a string.
            println!("You called {:?}()",
                     stringify!($func_name));
        }
    };
}

// Create functions named `foo` and `bar` with the above macro.
create_function!(foo);
create_function!(bar);

macro_rules! print_result {
    // This macro takes an expression of type `expr` and prints
    // it as a string along with its result.
    // The `expr` designator is used for expressions.
    ($expression:expr) => {
        // `stringify!` will convert the expression *as it is* into a string.
        println!("{:?} = {:?}",
                 stringify!($expression),
                 $expression);
    };
}

fn main() {
    foo();
    bar();

    print_result!(1u32 + 1);

    // Recall that blocks are expressions too!
    print_result!({
        let x = 1u32;

        x * x + 2 * x - 1
    });
}
```

These are some of the available designators:

* `block`
* `expr` is used for expressions
* `ident` is used for variable/function names
* `item`
* `literal` is used for literal constants
* `pat` (*pattern*)
* `path`
* `stmt` (*statement*)
* `tt` (*token tree*)
* `ty` (*type*)
* `vis` (*visibility qualifier*)

# DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

Macros allow writing DRY code by factoring out the common parts of functions
and/or test suites. Here is an example that implements and tests the `+=`, `*=`
and `-=` operators on `Vec<T>`:

```rust,editable
use std::ops::{Add, Mul, Sub};

            fn $func() {
                for size in 0usize..10 {
                    let mut x: Vec<_> = iter::repeat($x).take(size).collect();
                    let y: Vec<_> = iter::repeat($y).take(size).collect();
                    let z: Vec<_> = iter::repeat($z).take(size).collect();

# Domain Specific Languages (DSLs)

A DSL is a mini "language" embedded in a Rust macro. It is completely valid
Rust because the macro system expands into normal Rust constructs, but it looks
like a small language. This allows you to define concise or intuitive syntax for
some special functionality (within bounds).

Suppose that I want to define a little calculator API. I would like to supply
an expression and have the output printed to console.

```rust,editable
macro_rules! calculate {
    (eval $e:expr) => {
        {
            let val: usize = $e; // Force types to be unsigned integers
            println!("{} = {}", stringify!{$e}, val);
        }
    };
}

fn main() {
    calculate! {
        eval 1 + 2 // hehehe `eval` is _not_ a Rust keyword!
    }

    calculate! {
        eval (1 + 2) * (3 / 4)
    }
}
```

Output:

```txt
1 + 2 = 3
(1 + 2) * (3 / 4) = 0
```

This was a very simple example, but much more complex interfaces have been
developed, such as [`lazy_static`](https://crates.io/crates/lazy_static) or
[`clap`](https://crates.io/crates/clap).

Also, note the two pairs of braces in the macro. The outer ones are
part of the syntax of `macro_rules!`, in addition to `()` or `[]`.



================================================
FILE: src/macros/overload.md
================================================
# Overload

Macros can be overloaded to accept different combinations of arguments.
In that regard, `macro_rules!` can work similarly to a match block:

```rust,editable
// `test!` will compare `$left` and `$right`
// in different ways depending on how you invoke it:
macro_rules! test {
    // Arguments don't need to be separated by a comma.
    // Any template can be used!
    ($left:expr; and $right:expr) => {
        println!("{:?} and {:?} is {:?}",
                 stringify!($left),
                 stringify!($right),
                 $left && $right)
    };
    // ^ each arm must end with a semicolon.
    ($left:expr; or $right:expr) => {
        println!("{:?} or {:?} is {:?}",
                 stringify!($left),
                 stringify!($right),
                 $left || $right)
    };
}

fn main() {
    test!(1i32 + 1 == 2i32; and 2i32 * 2 == 4i32);
    test!(true; or false);
}
```



================================================
FILE: src/macros/repeat.md
================================================
# Repeat

Macros can use `+` in the argument list to indicate that an argument may
repeat at least once, or `*`, to indicate that the argument may repeat zero or
more times.

In the following example, surrounding the matcher with `$(...),+` will
match one or more expression, separated by commas.
Also note that the semicolon is optional on the last case.

```rust,editable
// `find_min!` will calculate the minimum of any number of arguments.
macro_rules! find_min {
    // Base case:
    ($x:expr) => ($x);
    // `$x` followed by at least one `$y,`
    ($x:expr, $($y:expr),+) => (
        // Call `find_min!` on the tail `$y`
        std::cmp::min($x, find_min!($($y),+))
    )
}

fn main() {
    println!("{}", find_min!(1));
    println!("{}", find_min!(1 + 2, 2));
    println!("{}", find_min!(5, 2 * 3, 4));
}
```

[overloading]: overload.md

================================================
FILE: src/macros/variadics.md
================================================
# Variadic Interfaces

A _variadic_ interface takes an arbitrary number of arguments. For example,
`println!` can take an arbitrary number of arguments, as determined by the
format string.

We can extend our `calculate!` macro from the previous section to be variadic:

```rust,editable
macro_rules! calculate {
    // The pattern for a single `eval`
    (eval $e:expr) => {
        {
            let val: usize = $e; // Force types to be integers
            println!("{} = {}", stringify!{$e}, val);
        }
    };

    // Decompose multiple `eval`s recursively
    (eval $e:expr, $(eval $es:expr),+) => {{
        calculate! { eval $e }
        calculate! { $(eval $es),+ }
    }};
}

fn main() {
    calculate! { // Look ma! Variadic `calculate!`!
        eval 1 + 2,
        eval 3 + 4,
        eval (2 * 3) + 1
    }
}
```

Output:

```txt
1 + 2 = 3
3 + 4 = 7
(2 * 3) + 1 = 7
```



================================================
FILE: src/meta/doc.md
================================================
# Documentation

Use `cargo doc` to build documentation in `target/doc`, `cargo doc --open`
will automatically open it in your web browser.

Use `cargo test` to run all tests (including documentation tests), and `cargo
test --doc` to only run documentation tests.

These commands will appropriately invoke `rustdoc` (and `rustc`) as required.

## Doc comments

Doc comments are very useful for big projects that require documentation. When
running `rustdoc`, these are the comments that get compiled into
documentation. They are denoted by a `///`, and support [Markdown].

````rust,editable,ignore
#![crate_name = "doc"]

/// A human being is represented here
pub struct Person {
    /// A person must have a name, no matter how much Juliet may hate it
    name: String,
}

impl Person {
    /// Creates a person with the given name.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```
    /// // You can have rust code between fences inside the comments
    /// // If you pass --test to `rustdoc`, it will even test it for you!
    /// use doc::Person;
    /// let person = Person::new("name");
    /// ```
    pub fn new(name: &str) -> Person {
        Person {
            name: name.to_string(),
        }
    }

    /// Gives a friendly hello!
    ///
    /// Says "Hello, [name](Person::name)" to the `Person` it is called on.
    pub fn hello(&self) {
        println!("Hello, {}!", self.name);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let john = Person::new("John");

    john.hello();
}
````

To run the tests, first build the code as a library, then tell `rustdoc` where
to find the library so it can link it into each doctest program:

```shell
$ rustc doc.rs --crate-type lib
$ rustdoc --test --extern doc="libdoc.rlib" doc.rs
```

## Doc attributes

Below are a few examples of the most common `#[doc]` attributes used with
`rustdoc`.

### `inline`

Used to inline docs, instead of linking out to separate page.

```rust,ignore
#[doc(inline)]
pub use bar::Bar;

/// bar docs
pub mod bar {
    /// the docs for Bar
    pub struct Bar;
}
```

### `no_inline`

Used to prevent linking out to separate page or anywhere.

```rust,ignore
// Example from libcore/prelude
#[doc(no_inline)]
pub use crate::mem::drop;
```

### `hidden`

Using this tells `rustdoc` not to include this in documentation:

```rust,editable,ignore
// Example from the futures-rs library
#[doc(hidden)]
pub use self::async_await::*;
```

For documentation, `rustdoc` is widely used by the community. It's what is used
to generate the [std library docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/).

FILE: src/meta/playground.md
================================================
# Playground

The [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/) is a way to experiment with
Rust code through a web interface.

## Using it with `mdbook`

In [`mdbook`][mdbook], you can make code examples playable and editable.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

This allows the reader to both run your code sample, but also modify and tweak
it. The key here is the adding of the word `editable` to your codefence block
separated by a comma.

````markdown
```rust,editable
//...place your code here
```
````

Additionally, you can add `ignore` if you want `mdbook` to skip your code when
it builds and tests.

````markdown
```rust,editable,ignore
//...place your code here
```
````

## Using it with docs

You may have noticed in some of the [official Rust docs][official-rust-docs] a
button that says "Run", which opens the code sample up in a new tab in Rust
Playground. This feature is enabled if you use the `#[doc]` attribute called
[`html_playground_url`][html-playground-url].

```text
#![doc(html_playground_url = "https://play.rust-lang.org/")]
//! ```
//! println!("Hello World");
//! ```
```

# File hierarchy

Modules can be mapped to a file/directory hierarchy. Let's break down the
[visibility example][visibility] in files:

```shell
$ tree .
.
├── my
│   ├── inaccessible.rs
│   └── nested.rs
├── my.rs
└── split.rs
```

In `split.rs`:

```rust,ignore
// This declaration will look for a file named `my.rs` and will
// insert its contents inside a module named `my` under this scope
mod my;

fn function() {
    println!("called `function()`");
}

fn main() {
    my::function();

    function();

    my::indirect_access();

    my::nested::function();
}

```

In `my.rs`:

```rust,ignore
// Similarly `mod inaccessible` and `mod nested` will locate the `nested.rs`
// and `inaccessible.rs` files and insert them here under their respective
// modules
mod inaccessible;
pub mod nested;

pub fn function() {
    println!("called `my::function()`");
}

fn private_function() {
    println!("called `my::private_function()`");
}

pub fn indirect_access() {
    print!("called `my::indirect_access()`, that\n> ");

    private_function();
}
```

In `my/nested.rs`:

```rust,ignore
pub fn function() {
    println!("called `my::nested::function()`");
}

#[allow(dead_code)]
fn private_function() {
    println!("called `my::nested::private_function()`");
}
```

In `my/inaccessible.rs`:

```rust,ignore
#[allow(dead_code)]
pub fn public_function() {
    println!("called `my::inaccessible::public_function()`");
}
```

Let's check that things still work as before:

```shell
$ rustc split.rs && ./split
called `my::function()`
called `function()`
called `my::indirect_access()`, that
> called `my::private_function()`
called `my::nested::function()`
```

FILE: src/mod/struct_visibility.md
================================================
# Struct visibility

Structs have an extra level of visibility with their fields. The visibility
defaults to private, and can be overridden with the `pub` modifier. This
visibility only matters when a struct is accessed from outside the module
where it is defined, and has the goal of hiding information (encapsulation).

```rust,editable
mod my {
    // A public struct with a public field of generic type `T`
    pub struct OpenBox<T> {
        pub contents: T,
    }

    // A public struct with a private field of generic type `T`
    pub struct ClosedBox<T> {
        contents: T,
    }

    impl<T> ClosedBox<T> {
        // A public constructor method
        pub fn new(contents: T) -> ClosedBox<T> {
            ClosedBox {
                contents: contents,
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Public structs with public fields can be constructed as usual
    let open_box = my::OpenBox { contents: "public information" };

    // and their fields can be normally accessed.
    println!("The open box contains: {}", open_box.contents);

    // Public structs with private fields cannot be constructed using field names.
    // Error! `ClosedBox` has private fields
    //let closed_box = my::ClosedBox { contents: "classified information" };
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line

    // However, structs with private fields can be created using
    // public constructors
    let _closed_box = my::ClosedBox::new("classified information");

    // and the private fields of a public struct cannot be accessed.
    // Error! The `contents` field is private
    //println!("The closed box contains: {}", _closed_box.contents);
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line
}
```

================================================
FILE: src/mod/super.md
================================================
# `super` and `self`

The `super` and `self` keywords can be used in the path to remove ambiguity
when accessing items and to prevent unnecessary hardcoding of paths.

```rust,editable
fn function() {
    println!("called `function()`");
}

mod cool {
    pub fn function() {
        println!("called `cool::function()`");
    }
}

mod my {
    fn function() {
        println!("called `my::function()`");
    }

    mod cool {
        pub fn function() {
            println!("called `my::cool::function()`");
        }
    }

    pub fn indirect_call() {
        // Let's access all the functions named `function` from this scope!
        print!("called `my::indirect_call()`, that\n> ");

        // The `self` keyword refers to the current module scope - in this case `my`.
        // Calling `self::function()` and calling `function()` directly both give
        // the same result, because they refer to the same function.
        self::function();
        function();

        // We can also use `self` to access another module inside `my`:
        self::cool::function();

        // The `super` keyword refers to the parent scope (outside the `my` module).
        super::function();

        // This will bind to the `cool::function` in the *crate* scope.
        // In this case the crate scope is the outermost scope.
        {
            use crate::cool::function as root_function;
            root_function();
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    my::indirect_call();
}
```



================================================
FILE: src/mod/use.md
================================================
# The `use` declaration

The `use` declaration can be used to bind a full path to a new name, for easier
access. It is often used like this:

```rust,editable,ignore
use crate::deeply::nested::{
    my_first_function,
    my_second_function,
    AndATraitType
};

fn main() {
    my_first_function();
}
```

You can use the `as` keyword to bind imports to a different name:

```rust,editable
// Bind the `deeply::nested::function` path to `other_function`.
use deeply::nested::function as other_function;

fn function() {
    println!("called `function()`");
}

mod deeply {
    pub mod nested {
        pub fn function() {
            println!("called `deeply::nested::function()`");
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Easier access to `deeply::nested::function`
    other_function();

    println!("Entering block");
    {
        // This is equivalent to `use deeply::nested::function as function`.
        // This `function()` will shadow the outer one.
        use crate::deeply::nested::function;

        // `use` bindings have a local scope. In this case, the
        // shadowing of `function()` is only in this block.
        function();

        println!("Leaving block");
    }

    function();
}
```

# Visibility

By default, the items in a module have private visibility, but this can be
overridden with the `pub` modifier. Only the public items of a module can be
accessed from outside the module scope.

```rust,editable
// A module named `my_mod`
mod my_mod {
    // Items in modules default to private visibility.
    fn private_function() {

    pub fn function() {

An array is a collection of objects of the same type `T`, stored in contiguous
memory. Arrays are created using brackets `[]`, and their length, which is known
at compile time, is part of their type signature `[T; length]`.

Slices are similar to arrays, but their length is not known at compile time.
Instead, a slice is a two-word object; the first word is a pointer to the data,
the second word is the length of the slice. The word size is the same as usize,
determined by the processor architecture, e.g. 64 bits on an x86-64. Slices can
be used to borrow a section of an array and have the type signature `&[T]`.

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
use std::mem;

// This function borrows a slice.
fn analyze_slice(slice: &[i32]) {
    println!("First element of the slice: {}", slice[0]);
    println!("The slice has {} elements", slice.len());
}

fn main() {
    // Fixed-size array (type signature is superfluous).
    let xs: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // All elements can be initialized to the same value.
    let ys: [i32; 500] = [0; 500];

    // Indexing starts at 0.
    println!("First element of the array: {}", xs[0]);
    println!("Second element of the array: {}", xs[1]);

    // `len` returns the count of elements in the array.
    println!("Number of elements in array: {}", xs.len());

    // Arrays are stack allocated.
    println!("Array occupies {} bytes", mem::size_of_val(&xs));

    // Arrays can be automatically borrowed as slices.
    println!("Borrow the whole array as a slice.");
    analyze_slice(&xs);

    // Slices can point to a section of an array.
    // They are of the form [starting_index..ending_index].
    // `starting_index` is the first position in the slice.
    // `ending_index` is one more than the last position in the slice.
    println!("Borrow a section of the array as a slice.");
    analyze_slice(&ys[1 .. 4]);

    // Example of empty slice `&[]`:
    let empty_array: [u32; 0] = [];
    assert_eq!(&empty_array, &[]);
    assert_eq!(&empty_array, &[][..]); // Same but more verbose

    // Arrays can be safely accessed using `.get`, which returns an
    // `Option`. This can be matched as shown below, or used with
    // `.expect()` if you would like the program to exit with a nice
    // message instead of happily continue.
    for i in 0..xs.len() + 1 { // Oops, one element too far!
        match xs.get(i) {
            Some(xval) => println!("{}: {}", i, xval),
            None => println!("Slow down! {} is too far!", i),
        }
    }

    // Out of bound indexing on array with constant value causes compile time error.
    //println!("{}", xs[5]);
    // Out of bound indexing on slice causes runtime error.
    //println!("{}", xs[..][5]);
}
```

# Literals and operators

Integers `1`, floats `1.2`, characters `'a'`, strings `"abc"`, booleans `true`
and the unit type `()` can be expressed using literals.

Integers can, alternatively, be expressed using hexadecimal, octal or binary
notation using these prefixes respectively: `0x`, `0o` or `0b`.

Underscores can be inserted in numeric literals to improve readability, e.g.
`1_000` is the same as `1000`, and `0.000_001` is the same as `0.000001`.

Rust also supports scientific [E-notation][enote], e.g. `1e6`, `7.6e-4`. The
associated type is `f64`.

We need to tell the compiler the type of the literals we use. For now,
we'll use the `u32` suffix to indicate that the literal is an unsigned 32-bit
integer, and the `i32` suffix to indicate that it's a signed 32-bit integer.

The operators available and their precedence [in Rust][rust op-prec] are similar
to other [C-like languages][op-prec].

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    // Integer addition
    println!("1 + 2 = {}", 1u32 + 2);

    // Integer subtraction
    println!("1 - 2 = {}", 1i32 - 2);
    // TODO ^ Try changing `1i32` to `1u32` to see why the type is important

    // Scientific notation
    println!("1e4 is {}, -2.5e-3 is {}", 1e4, -2.5e-3);

    // Short-circuiting boolean logic
    println!("true AND false is {}", true && false);
    println!("true OR false is {}", true || false);
    println!("NOT true is {}", !true);

    // Bitwise operations
    println!("0011 AND 0101 is {:04b}", 0b0011u32 & 0b0101);
    println!("0011 OR 0101 is {:04b}", 0b0011u32 | 0b0101);
    println!("0011 XOR 0101 is {:04b}", 0b0011u32 ^ 0b0101);
    println!("1 << 5 is {}", 1u32 << 5);
    println!("0x80 >> 2 is 0x{:x}", 0x80u32 >> 2);

    // Use underscores to improve readability!
    println!("One million is written as {}", 1_000_000u32);
}
```

# Tuples

A tuple is a collection of values of different types. Tuples are constructed
using parentheses `()`, and each tuple itself is a value with type signature
`(T1, T2, ...)`, where `T1`, `T2` are the types of its members. Functions can
use tuples to return multiple values, as tuples can hold any number of values.

```rust,editable
// Tuples can be used as function arguments and as return values.
fn reverse(pair: (i32, bool)) -> (bool, i32) {
    // `let` can be used to bind the members of a tuple to variables.
    let (int_param, bool_param) = pair;

    (bool_param, int_param)
}

// The following struct is for the activity.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Matrix(f32, f32, f32, f32);

fn main() {
    // A tuple with a bunch of different types.
    let long_tuple = (1u8, 2u16, 3u32, 4u64,
                      -1i8, -2i16, -3i32, -4i64,
                      0.1f32, 0.2f64,
                      'a', true);

    // Values can be extracted from the tuple using tuple indexing.
    println!("Long tuple first value: {}", long_tuple.0);
    println!("Long tuple second value: {}", long_tuple.1);

    // Tuples can be tuple members.
    let tuple_of_tuples = ((1u8, 2u16, 2u32), (4u64, -1i8), -2i16);

    // Tuples are printable.
    println!("tuple of tuples: {:?}", tuple_of_tuples);

    // But long Tuples (more than 12 elements) cannot be printed.
    //let too_long_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13);
    //println!("Too long tuple: {:?}", too_long_tuple);
    // TODO ^ Uncomment the above 2 lines to see the compiler error

    let pair = (1, true);
    println!("Pair is {:?}", pair);

    println!("The reversed pair is {:?}", reverse(pair));

    // To create one element tuples, the comma is required to tell them apart
    // from a literal surrounded by parentheses.
    println!("One element tuple: {:?}", (5u32,));
    println!("Just an integer: {:?}", (5u32));

    // Tuples can be destructured to create bindings.
    let tuple = (1, "hello", 4.5, true);

    let (a, b, c, d) = tuple;
    println!("{:?}, {:?}, {:?}, {:?}", a, b, c, d);

    let matrix = Matrix(1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2);
    println!("{:?}", matrix);
}
```

### Activity

1. *Recap*: Add the `fmt::Display` trait to the `Matrix` struct in the above
   example, so that if you switch from printing the debug format `{:?}` to the
   display format `{}`, you see the following output:

   ```text
   ( 1.1 1.2 )
   ( 2.1 2.2 )
   ```

   You may want to refer back to the example for [print display][print_display].
2. Add a `transpose` function using the `reverse` function as a template, which
   accepts a matrix as an argument, and returns a matrix in which two elements
   have been swapped. For example:

   ```rust,ignore
   println!("Matrix:\n{}", matrix);
   println!("Transpose:\n{}", transpose(matrix));
   ```

   Results in the output:

   ```text
   Matrix:
   ( 1.1 1.2 )
   ( 2.1 2.2 )
   Transpose:
   ( 1.1 2.1 )
   ( 1.2 2.2 )
   ```

# Borrowing

Most of the time, we'd like to access data without taking ownership over
it. To accomplish this, Rust uses a *borrowing* mechanism. Instead of
passing objects by value (`T`), objects can be passed by reference (`&T`).

The compiler statically guarantees (via its borrow checker) that references
*always* point to valid objects. That is, while references to an object
exist, the object cannot be destroyed.

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
// This function takes ownership of a box and destroys it
fn eat_box_i32(boxed_i32: Box<i32>) {
    println!("Destroying box that contains {}", boxed_i32);
}

// This function borrows an i32
fn borrow_i32(borrowed_i32: &i32) {
    println!("This int is: {}", borrowed_i32);
}

fn main() {
    // Create a boxed i32 in the heap, and an i32 on the stack
    // Remember: numbers can have arbitrary underscores added for readability
    // 5_i32 is the same as 5i32
    let boxed_i32 = Box::new(5_i32);
    let stacked_i32 = 6_i32;

    // Borrow the contents of the box. Ownership is not taken,
    // so the contents can be borrowed again.
    borrow_i32(&boxed_i32);
    borrow_i32(&stacked_i32);

    {
        // Take a reference to the data contained inside the box
        let _ref_to_i32: &i32 = &boxed_i32;

        // Error!
        // Can't destroy `boxed_i32` while the inner value is borrowed later in scope.
        eat_box_i32(boxed_i32);
        // FIXME ^ Comment out this line

        // Attempt to borrow `_ref_to_i32` after inner value is destroyed
        borrow_i32(_ref_to_i32);
        // `_ref_to_i32` goes out of scope and is no longer borrowed.
    }

    // `boxed_i32` can now give up ownership to `eat_box_i32` and be destroyed
    eat_box_i32(boxed_i32);
}
```



================================================
FILE: src/scope/lifetime.md
================================================
# Lifetimes

A *lifetime* is a construct the compiler (or more specifically, its *borrow
checker*) uses to ensure all borrows are valid. Specifically, a variable's
lifetime begins when it is created and ends when it is destroyed. While
lifetimes and scopes are often referred to together, they are not the same.

Take, for example, the case where we borrow a variable via `&`. The
borrow has a lifetime that is determined by where it is declared. As a result,
the borrow is valid as long as it ends before the lender is destroyed. However,
the scope of the borrow is determined by where the reference is used.

In the following example and in the rest of this section, we will see how
lifetimes relate to scopes, as well as how the two differ.

```rust,editable
// Lifetimes are annotated below with lines denoting the creation
// and destruction of each variable.
// `i` has the longest lifetime because its scope entirely encloses
// both `borrow1` and `borrow2`. The duration of `borrow1` compared
// to `borrow2` is irrelevant since they are disjoint.
fn main() {
    let i = 3; // Lifetime for `i` starts. ────────────────┐
    //                                                     │
    { //                                                   │
        let borrow1 = &i; // `borrow1` lifetime starts. ──┐│
        //                                                ││
        println!("borrow1: {}", borrow1); //              ││
    } // `borrow1` ends. ─────────────────────────────────┘│
    //                                                     │
    //                                                     │
    { //                                                   │
        let borrow2 = &i; // `borrow2` lifetime starts. ──┐│
        //                                                ││
        println!("borrow2: {}", borrow2); //              ││
    } // `borrow2` ends. ─────────────────────────────────┘│
    //                                                     │
}   // Lifetime ends. ─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Note that no names or types are assigned to label lifetimes.
This restricts how lifetimes will be able to be used as we will see.

FILE: src/scope/move.md
================================================
# Ownership and moves

Because variables are in charge of freeing their own resources,
**resources can only have one owner**. This prevents resources
from being freed more than once. Note that not all variables own
resources (e.g. [references]).

When doing assignments (`let x = y`) or passing function arguments by value
(`foo(x)`), the *ownership* of the resources is transferred. In Rust-speak,
this is known as a *move*.

After moving resources, the previous owner can no longer be used. This avoids
creating dangling pointers.

```rust,editable
// This function takes ownership of the heap allocated memory
fn destroy_box(c: Box<i32>) {
    println!("Destroying a box that contains {}", c);

    // `c` is destroyed and the memory freed
}

fn main() {
    // _Stack_ allocated integer
    let x = 5u32;

    // *Copy* `x` into `y` - no resources are moved
    let y = x;

    // Both values can be independently used
    println!("x is {}, and y is {}", x, y);

    // `a` is a pointer to a _heap_ allocated integer
    let a = Box::new(5i32);

    println!("a contains: {}", a);

    // *Move* `a` into `b`
    let b = a;
    // The pointer address of `a` is copied (not the data) into `b`.
    // Both are now pointers to the same heap allocated data, but
    // `b` now owns it.

    // Error! `a` can no longer access the data, because it no longer owns the
    // heap memory
    //println!("a contains: {}", a);
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line

    // This function takes ownership of the heap allocated memory from `b`
    destroy_box(b);

    // Since the heap memory has been freed at this point, this action would
    // result in dereferencing freed memory, but it's forbidden by the compiler
    // Error! Same reason as the previous Error
    //println!("b contains: {}", b);
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line
}
```

FILE: src/scope/raii.md
================================================
# RAII

Variables in Rust do more than just hold data in the stack: they also *own*
resources, e.g. `Box<T>` owns memory in the heap. Rust enforces [RAII][raii]
(Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), so whenever an object goes out of
scope, its destructor is called and its owned resources are freed.

This behavior shields against *resource leak* bugs, so you'll never have to
manually free memory or worry about memory leaks again! Here's a quick showcase:

```rust,editable
// raii.rs
fn create_box() {
    // Allocate an integer on the heap
    let _box1 = Box::new(3i32);

    // `_box1` is destroyed here, and memory gets freed
}

fn main() {
    // Allocate an integer on the heap
    let _box2 = Box::new(5i32);

    // A nested scope:
    {
        // Allocate an integer on the heap
        let _box3 = Box::new(4i32);

        // `_box3` is destroyed here, and memory gets freed
    }

    // Creating lots of boxes just for fun
    // There's no need to manually free memory!
    for _ in 0u32..1_000 {
        create_box();
    }

    // `_box2` is destroyed here, and memory gets freed
}
```

Of course, we can double check for memory errors using [`valgrind`][valgrind]:

<!-- REUSE-IgnoreStart -->
<!-- Prevent REUSE from parsing the copyright statement in the sample code -->
```shell
$ rustc raii.rs && valgrind ./raii
==26873== Memcheck, a memory error detector

```
<!-- REUSE-IgnoreEnd -->

No leaks here!

## Destructor

The notion of a destructor in Rust is provided through the [`Drop`] trait. The
destructor is called when the resource goes out of scope. This trait is not
required to be implemented for every type, only implement it for your type if
you require its own destructor logic.

Run the below example to see how the [`Drop`] trait works. When the variable in
the `main` function goes out of scope the custom destructor will be invoked.

```rust,editable
struct ToDrop;

impl Drop for ToDrop {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("ToDrop is being dropped");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = ToDrop;
    println!("Made a ToDrop!");
}
```

# Aliasing

Data can be immutably borrowed any number of times, but while immutably
borrowed, the original data can't be mutably borrowed. On the other hand, only
*one* mutable borrow is allowed at a time. The original data can be borrowed
again only *after* the mutable reference has been used for the last time.

```rust,editable
struct Point { x: i32, y: i32, z: i32 }

fn main() {
    let mut point = Point { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 };

    let borrowed_point = &point;
    let another_borrow = &point;

    // Data can be accessed via the references and the original owner
    println!("Point has coordinates: ({}, {}, {})",
                borrowed_point.x, another_borrow.y, point.z);

    // The borrowed values are used again here
    println!("Point has coordinates: ({}, {}, {})",

# Mutability

Mutable data can be mutably borrowed using `&mut T`. This is called
a *mutable reference* and gives read/write access to the borrower.
In contrast, `&T` borrows the data via an immutable reference, and
the borrower can read the data but not modify it:

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
#[allow(dead_code)]
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct Book {
    // `&'static str` is a reference to a string allocated in read only memory
    author: &'static str,

    year: u32,
}

// This function takes a reference to a book
fn borrow_book(book: &Book) {
    println!("I immutably borrowed {} - {} edition", book.title, book.year);
}

// This function takes a reference to a mutable book and changes `year` to 2014
fn new_edition(book: &mut Book) {
    book.year = 2014;
    println!("I mutably borrowed {} - {} edition", book.title, book.year);
}

fn main() {
    // Create an immutable Book named `immutabook`
    let immutabook = Book {
        // string literals have type `&'static str`
        author: "Douglas Hofstadter",

    // Create a mutable copy of `immutabook` and call it `mutabook`
    let mut mutabook = immutabook;

    // Immutably borrow an immutable object
    borrow_book(&immutabook);

    // Immutably borrow a mutable object

# The ref pattern

When doing pattern matching or destructuring via the `let` binding, the `ref`
keyword can be used to take references to the fields of a struct/tuple. The
example below shows a few instances where this can be useful:

```rust,editable
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }

fn main() {
    let c = 'Q';

    // A `ref` borrow on the left side of an assignment is equivalent to
    // an `&` borrow on the right side.
    let ref ref_c1 = c;
    let ref_c2 = &c;

    println!("ref_c1 equals ref_c2: {}", *ref_c1 == *ref_c2);

    let point = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };

# Elision

Some lifetime patterns are overwhelmingly common and so the borrow checker
will allow you to omit them to save typing and to improve readability.
This is known as elision. Elision exists in Rust solely because these patterns
are common.

The following code shows a few examples of elision. For a more comprehensive
description of elision, see [lifetime elision][elision] in the book.

```rust,editable
// `elided_input` and `annotated_input` essentially have identical signatures
// because the lifetime of `elided_input` is inferred by the compiler:
fn elided_input(x: &i32) {
    println!("`elided_input`: {}", x);
}

fn annotated_input<'a>(x: &'a i32) {
    println!("`annotated_input`: {}", x);
}

// Similarly, `elided_pass` and `annotated_pass` have identical signatures
// because the lifetime is added implicitly to `elided_pass`:
fn elided_pass(x: &i32) -> &i32 { x }

fn annotated_pass<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32 { x }

fn main() {
    let x = 3;

    elided_input(&x);
    annotated_input(&x);

    println!("`elided_pass`: {}", elided_pass(&x));
    println!("`annotated_pass`: {}", annotated_pass(&x));
}
```

================================================
# Explicit annotation

The borrow checker uses explicit lifetime annotations to determine
how long references should be valid. In cases where lifetimes are not
elided[^1], Rust requires explicit annotations to determine what the
lifetime of a reference should be. The syntax for explicitly annotating
a lifetime uses an apostrophe character as follows:

```rust,ignore
foo<'a>
// `foo` has a lifetime parameter `'a`
```

Similar to [closures][anonymity], using lifetimes requires generics.
Additionally, this lifetime syntax indicates that the lifetime of `foo`
may not exceed that of `'a`. Explicit annotation of a type has the form
`&'a T` where `'a` has already been introduced.

In cases with multiple lifetimes, the syntax is similar:

```rust,ignore
foo<'a, 'b>
// `foo` has lifetime parameters `'a` and `'b`
```

In this case, the lifetime of `foo` cannot exceed that of either `'a` *or* `'b`.

See the following example for explicit lifetime annotation in use:

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
// `print_refs` takes two references to `i32` which have different
// lifetimes `'a` and `'b`. These two lifetimes must both be at
// least as long as the function `print_refs`.
fn print_refs<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32) {
    println!("x is {} and y is {}", x, y);
}

// A function which takes no arguments, but has a lifetime parameter `'a`.
fn failed_borrow<'a>() {
    let _x = 12;

    // ERROR: `_x` does not live long enough
    let _y: &'a i32 = &_x;
    // Attempting to use the lifetime `'a` as an explicit type annotation
    // inside the function will fail because the lifetime of `&_x` is shorter
    // than that of `_y`. A short lifetime cannot be coerced into a longer one.
}

fn main() {
    // Create variables to be borrowed below.
    let (four, nine) = (4, 9);

    // Borrows (`&`) of both variables are passed into the function.
    print_refs(&four, &nine);
    // Any input which is borrowed must outlive the borrower.
    // In other words, the lifetime of `four` and `nine` must
    // be longer than that of `print_refs`.

    failed_borrow();
    // `failed_borrow` contains no references to force `'a` to be
    // longer than the lifetime of the function, but `'a` is longer.
    // Because the lifetime is never constrained, it defaults to `'static`.
}
```

[^1]: [elision] implicitly annotates lifetimes and so is different.

# Functions

Ignoring [elision], function signatures with lifetimes have a few constraints:

* any reference *must* have an annotated lifetime.
* any reference being returned *must* have the same lifetime as an input or
be `static`.

Additionally, note that returning references without input is banned if it
would result in returning references to invalid data. The following example shows
off some valid forms of functions with lifetimes:

```rust,editable
// One input reference with lifetime `'a` which must live
// at least as long as the function.
fn print_one<'a>(x: &'a i32) {
    println!("`print_one`: x is {}", x);
}

// Mutable references are possible with lifetimes as well.
fn add_one<'a>(x: &'a mut i32) {
    *x += 1;
}

// Multiple elements with different lifetimes. In this case, it
// would be fine for both to have the same lifetime `'a`, but
// in more complex cases, different lifetimes may be required.
fn print_multi<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32) {
    println!("`print_multi`: x is {}, y is {}", x, y);
}

// Returning references that have been passed in is acceptable.
// However, the correct lifetime must be returned.
fn pass_x<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, _: &'b i32) -> &'a i32 { x }

//fn invalid_output<'a>() -> &'a String { &String::from("foo") }
// The above is invalid: `'a` must live longer than the function.
// Here, `&String::from("foo")` would create a `String`, followed by a
// reference. Then the data is dropped upon exiting the scope, leaving
// a reference to invalid data to be returned.

fn main() {
    let x = 7;
    let y = 9;

    print_one(&x);
    print_multi(&x, &y);

    let z = pass_x(&x, &y);
    print_one(z);

    let mut t = 3;
    add_one(&mut t);
    print_one(&t);
}
```

================================================
# Bounds

Just like generic types can be bounded, lifetimes (themselves generic)
use bounds as well. The `:` character has a slightly different meaning here,
but `+` is the same. Note how the following read:

1. `T: 'a`: *All* references in `T` must outlive lifetime `'a`.
2. `T: Trait + 'a`: Type `T` must implement trait `Trait` and *all* references
in `T` must outlive `'a`.

The example below shows the above syntax in action used after keyword `where`:

```rust,editable
use std::fmt::Debug; // Trait to bound with.

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Ref<'a, T: 'a>(&'a T);
// `Ref` contains a reference to a generic type `T` that has
// some lifetime `'a` unknown by `Ref`. `T` is bounded such that any
// *references* in `T` must outlive `'a`. Additionally, the lifetime
// of `Ref` may not exceed `'a`.

// A generic function which prints using the `Debug` trait.
fn print<T>(t: T) where
    T: Debug {
    println!("`print`: t is {:?}", t);
}

// Here a reference to `T` is taken where `T` implements
// `Debug` and all *references* in `T` outlive `'a`. In
// addition, `'a` must outlive the function.
fn print_ref<'a, T>(t: &'a T) where
    T: Debug + 'a {
    println!("`print_ref`: t is {:?}", t);
}

fn main() {
    let x = 7;
    let ref_x = Ref(&x);

    print_ref(&ref_x);
    print(ref_x);
}
```

FILE: src/scope/lifetime/lifetime_coercion.md
================================================
# Coercion

A longer lifetime can be coerced into a shorter one
so that it works inside a scope it normally wouldn't work in.
This comes in the form of inferred coercion by the Rust compiler,
and also in the form of declaring a lifetime difference:

```rust,editable
// Here, Rust infers a lifetime that is as short as possible.
// The two references are then coerced to that lifetime.
fn multiply<'a>(first: &'a i32, second: &'a i32) -> i32 {
    first * second
}

// `<'a: 'b, 'b>` reads as lifetime `'a` is at least as long as `'b`.
// Here, we take in an `&'a i32` and return a `&'b i32` as a result of coercion.
fn choose_first<'a: 'b, 'b>(first: &'a i32, _: &'b i32) -> &'b i32 {
    first
}

fn main() {
    let first = 2; // Longer lifetime

    {
        let second = 3; // Shorter lifetime

        println!("The product is {}", multiply(&first, &second));
        println!("{} is the first", choose_first(&first, &second));
    };
}
```



================================================
FILE: src/scope/lifetime/methods.md
================================================
# Methods

Methods are annotated similarly to functions:

```rust,editable
struct Owner(i32);

impl Owner {
    // Annotate lifetimes as in a standalone function.
    fn add_one<'a>(&'a mut self) { self.0 += 1; }
    fn print<'a>(&'a self) {
        println!("`print`: {}", self.0);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut owner = Owner(18);

    owner.add_one();
    owner.print();
}
```

================================================
FILE: src/scope/lifetime/static_lifetime.md
================================================
# Static

Rust has a few reserved lifetime names. One of those is `'static`. You
might encounter it in two situations:

```rust, ignore
// A reference with 'static lifetime:
let s: &'static str = "hello world";

// 'static as part of a trait bound:
fn generic<T>(x: T) where T: 'static {}
```

Both are related but subtly different and this is a common source for
confusion when learning Rust. Here are some examples for each situation:

## Reference lifetime

As a reference lifetime `'static` indicates that the data pointed to by
the reference lives for the remaining lifetime of the running program.
It can still be coerced to a shorter lifetime.

There are two common ways to make a variable with `'static` lifetime, and both
are stored in the read-only memory of the binary:

* Make a constant with the `static` declaration.
* Make a `string` literal which has type: `&'static str`.

See the following example for a display of each method:

```rust,editable
// Make a constant with `'static` lifetime.
static NUM: i32 = 18;

// Returns a reference to `NUM` where its `'static`
// lifetime is coerced to that of the input argument.
fn coerce_static<'a>(_: &'a i32) -> &'a i32 {
    &NUM
}

fn main() {
    {
        // Make a `string` literal and print it:
        let static_string = "I'm in read-only memory";
        println!("static_string: {}", static_string);

        // When `static_string` goes out of scope, the reference
        // can no longer be used, but the data remains in the binary.
    }

    {
        // Make an integer to use for `coerce_static`:
        let lifetime_num = 9;

        // Coerce `NUM` to lifetime of `lifetime_num`:
        let coerced_static = coerce_static(&lifetime_num);

        println!("coerced_static: {}", coerced_static);
    }

    println!("NUM: {} stays accessible!", NUM);
}
```

Since `'static` references only need to be valid for the _remainder_ of
a program's life, they can be created while the program is executed. Just to
demonstrate, the below example uses
[`Box::leak`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html#method.leak)
to dynamically create `'static` references. In that case it definitely doesn't
live for the entire duration, but only from the leaking point onward.

```rust,editable,compile_fail
extern crate rand;
use rand::Fill;

fn random_vec() -> &'static [usize; 100] {
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    let mut boxed = Box::new([0; 100]);
    boxed.try_fill(&mut rng).unwrap();
    Box::leak(boxed)
}

fn main() {
    let first: &'static [usize; 100] = random_vec();
    let second: &'static [usize; 100] = random_vec();
    assert_ne!(first, second)
}
```

## Trait bound

As a trait bound, it means the type does not contain any non-static
references. Eg. the receiver can hold on to the type for as long as
they want and it will never become invalid until they drop it.

It's important to understand this means that any owned data always passes
a `'static` lifetime bound, but a reference to that owned data generally
does not:

```rust,editable,compile_fail
use std::fmt::Debug;

fn print_it( input: impl Debug + 'static ) {
    println!( "'static value passed in is: {:?}", input );
}

fn main() {
    // i is owned and contains no references, thus it's 'static:
    let i = 5;
    print_it(i);

    // oops, &i only has the lifetime defined by the scope of
    // main(), so it's not 'static:
    print_it(&i);
}
```

The compiler will tell you:

```ignore
error[E0597]: `i` does not live long enough
  --> src/lib.rs:15:15
   |
15 |     print_it(&i);
   |     ---------^^--
   |     |         |
   |     |         borrowed value does not live long enough
   |     argument requires that `i` is borrowed for `'static`
16 | }
   | - `i` dropped here while still borrowed
```

# Structs

Annotation of lifetimes in structures are also similar to functions:

```rust,editable
// A type `Borrowed` which houses a reference to an
// `i32`. The reference to `i32` must outlive `Borrowed`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Borrowed<'a>(&'a i32);

// Similarly, both references here must outlive this structure.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct NamedBorrowed<'a> {
    x: &'a i32,
    y: &'a i32,
}

// An enum which is either an `i32` or a reference to one.
#[derive(Debug)]
enum Either<'a> {
    Num(i32),
    Ref(&'a i32),
}

fn main() {
    let x = 18;
    let y = 15;

    let single = Borrowed(&x);
    let double = NamedBorrowed { x: &x, y: &y };
    let reference = Either::Ref(&x);
    let number    = Either::Num(y);

    println!("x is borrowed in {:?}", single);
    println!("x and y are borrowed in {:?}", double);
    println!("x is borrowed in {:?}", reference);

    // Mutability error
    //*immutable_box = 4;

    let mut mutable_box = immutable_box;

    *mutable_box = 4;

    println!("mutable_box now contains {}", mutable_box);

```



================================================
FILE: src/scope/move/partial_move.md
================================================
# Partial moves

Within the [destructuring] of a single variable, both `by-move` and
`by-reference` pattern bindings can be used at the same time. Doing
this will result in a _partial move_ of the variable, which means
that parts of the variable will be moved while other parts stay. In
such a case, the parent variable cannot be used afterwards as a
whole, however the parts that are only referenced (and not moved)
can still be used. Note that types that implement the
[`Drop` trait][droptrait] cannot be partially moved from, because
its `drop` method would use it afterwards as a whole.


```rust,editable
fn main() {
    #[derive(Debug)]
    struct Person {
        name: String,
        age: Box<u8>,
    }

    // Error! cannot move out of a type which implements the `Drop` trait
    //impl Drop for Person {
    //    fn drop(&mut self) {
    //        println!("Dropping the person struct {:?}", self)
    //    }
    //}
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting these lines

    let person = Person {
        name: String::from("Alice"),
        age: Box::new(20),
    };

    // `name` is moved out of person, but `age` is referenced
    let Person { name, ref age } = person;

    println!("The person's age is {}", age);

    println!("The person's name is {}", name);

    // Error! borrow of partially moved value: `person` partial move occurs
    //println!("The person struct is {:?}", person);

    // `person` cannot be used but `person.age` can be used as it is not moved
    println!("The person's age from person struct is {}", person.age);
}
```

(In this example, we store the `age` variable on the heap to
illustrate the partial move: deleting `ref` in the above code would
give an error as the ownership of `person.age` would be moved to the
variable `age`. If `Person.age` were stored on the stack, `ref` would
not be required as the definition of `age` would copy the data from
`person.age` without moving it.)

FILE: src/std/arc.md
================================================
# Arc

When shared ownership between threads is needed, `Arc`(Atomically Reference
Counted) can be used. This struct, via the `Clone` implementation can create
a reference pointer for the location of a value in the memory heap while
increasing the reference counter. As it shares ownership between threads, when
the last reference pointer to a value is out of scope, the variable is dropped.

```rust,editable
use std::time::Duration;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    // This variable declaration is where its value is specified.
    let apple = Arc::new("the same apple");

    for _ in 0..10 {
        // Here there is no value specification as it is a pointer to a
        // reference in the memory heap.
        let apple = Arc::clone(&apple);

        thread::spawn(move || {
            // As Arc was used, threads can be spawned using the value allocated
            // in the Arc variable pointer's location.
            println!("{:?}", apple);
        });
    }

    // Make sure all Arc instances are printed from spawned threads.
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
}
```



================================================
FILE: src/std/box.md
================================================
# Box, stack and heap

All values in Rust are stack allocated by default. Values can be *boxed*
(allocated on the heap) by creating a `Box<T>`. A box is a smart pointer to a
heap allocated value of type `T`. When a box goes out of scope, its destructor
is called, the inner object is destroyed, and the memory on the heap is freed.

Boxed values can be dereferenced using the `*` operator; this removes one layer
of indirection.

```rust,editable
use std::mem;

#[allow(dead_code)]
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

// A Rectangle can be specified by where its top left and bottom right
// corners are in space
#[allow(dead_code)]
struct Rectangle {
    top_left: Point,
    bottom_right: Point,
}

fn origin() -> Point {
    Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }
}

fn boxed_origin() -> Box<Point> {
    // Allocate this point on the heap, and return a pointer to it
    Box::new(Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 })
}

fn main() {
    // (all the type annotations are superfluous)
    // Stack allocated variables
    let point: Point = origin();
    let rectangle: Rectangle = Rectangle {
        top_left: origin(),
        bottom_right: Point { x: 3.0, y: -4.0 }
    };

    // Heap allocated rectangle
    let boxed_rectangle: Box<Rectangle> = Box::new(Rectangle {
        top_left: origin(),
        bottom_right: Point { x: 3.0, y: -4.0 },
    });

    // The output of functions can be boxed
    let boxed_point: Box<Point> = Box::new(origin());

    // Double indirection
    let box_in_a_box: Box<Box<Point>> = Box::new(boxed_origin());

    println!("Point occupies {} bytes on the stack",
             mem::size_of_val(&point));
    println!("Rectangle occupies {} bytes on the stack",
             mem::size_of_val(&rectangle));

    // box size == pointer size
    println!("Boxed point occupies {} bytes on the stack",
             mem::size_of_val(&boxed_point));
    println!("Boxed rectangle occupies {} bytes on the stack",
             mem::size_of_val(&boxed_rectangle));
    println!("Boxed box occupies {} bytes on the stack",
             mem::size_of_val(&box_in_a_box));

    // Copy the data contained in `boxed_point` into `unboxed_point`
    let unboxed_point: Point = *boxed_point;

# HashMap

Where vectors store values by an integer index, `HashMap`s store values by key.
`HashMap` keys can be booleans, integers, strings,
or any other type that implements the `Eq` and `Hash` traits.
More on this in the next section.

Like vectors, `HashMap`s are growable, but HashMaps can also shrink themselves
when they have excess space.
You can create a HashMap with a certain starting capacity using
`HashMap::with_capacity(uint)`, or use `HashMap::new()` to get a HashMap
with a default initial capacity (recommended).

```rust,editable
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn call(number: &str) -> &str {
    match number {
        "798-1364" => "We're sorry, the call cannot be completed as dialed.

# `Option`

Sometimes it's desirable to catch the failure of some parts of a program
instead of calling `panic!`; this can be accomplished using the `Option` enum.

The `Option<T>` enum has two variants:

* `None`, to indicate failure or lack of value, and
* `Some(value)`, a tuple struct that wraps a `value` with type `T`.

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
// An integer division that doesn't `panic!`
fn checked_division(dividend: i32, divisor: i32) -> Option<i32> {
    if divisor == 0 {
        // Failure is represented as the `None` variant
        None
    } else {
        // Result is wrapped in a `Some` variant
        Some(dividend / divisor)
    }
}

// This function handles a division that may not succeed
fn try_division(dividend: i32, divisor: i32) {
    // `Option` values can be pattern matched, just like other enums
    match checked_division(dividend, divisor) {
        None => println!("{} / {} failed!", dividend, divisor),
        Some(quotient) => {
            println!("{} / {} = {}", dividend, divisor, quotient)
        },
    }
}

fn main() {
    try_division(4, 2);
    try_division(1, 0);

    // Binding `None` to a variable needs to be type annotated
    let none: Option<i32> = None;
    let _equivalent_none = None::<i32>;

    let optional_float = Some(0f32);

    // Unwrapping a `Some` variant will extract the value wrapped.
    println!("{:?} unwraps to {:?}", optional_float, optional_float.unwrap());

    // Unwrapping a `None` variant will `panic!`
    println!("{:?} unwraps to {:?}", none, none.unwrap());
}
```



================================================
FILE: src/std/panic.md
================================================
# `panic!`

The `panic!` macro can be used to generate a panic and start unwinding
its stack. While unwinding, the runtime will take care of freeing all the
resources *owned* by the thread by calling the destructor of all its objects.

Since we are dealing with programs with only one thread, `panic!` will cause the
program to report the panic message and exit.

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
// Re-implementation of integer division (/)
fn division(dividend: i32, divisor: i32) -> i32 {
    if divisor == 0 {
        // Division by zero triggers a panic
        panic!("division by zero");
    } else {
        dividend / divisor
    }
}

// The `main` task
fn main() {
    // Heap allocated integer
    let _x = Box::new(0i32);

    // This operation will trigger a task failure
    division(3, 0);

    println!("This point won't be reached!");

    // `_x` should get destroyed at this point
}
```

Let's check that `panic!` doesn't leak memory.

# `Rc`

When multiple ownership is needed, `Rc`(Reference Counting) can be used. `Rc`
keeps track of the number of the references which means the number of owners of
the value wrapped inside an `Rc`.

Reference count of an `Rc` increases by 1 whenever an `Rc` is cloned, and
decreases by 1 whenever one cloned `Rc` is dropped out of the scope. When an
`Rc`'s reference count becomes zero (which means there are no remaining owners),
both the `Rc` and the value are all dropped.

Cloning an `Rc` never performs a deep copy. Cloning creates just another pointer
to the wrapped value, and increments the count.

```rust,editable
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let rc_examples = "Rc examples".to_string();
    {
        println!("--- rc_a is created ---");

        let rc_a: Rc<String> = Rc::new(rc_examples);
        println!("Reference Count of rc_a: {}", Rc::strong_count(&rc_a));

        {
            println!("--- rc_a is cloned to rc_b ---");

            let rc_b: Rc<String> = Rc::clone(&rc_a);
            println!("Reference Count of rc_b: {}", Rc::strong_count(&rc_b));
            println!("Reference Count of rc_a: {}", Rc::strong_count(&rc_a));

            // Two `Rc`s are equal if their inner values are equal
            println!("rc_a and rc_b are equal: {}", rc_a.eq(&rc_b));

            // We can use methods of a value directly
            println!("Length of the value inside rc_a: {}", rc_a.len());
            println!("Value of rc_b: {}", rc_b);

            println!("--- rc_b is dropped out of scope ---");
        }

        println!("Reference Count of rc_a: {}", Rc::strong_count(&rc_a));

        println!("--- rc_a is dropped out of scope ---");
    }

    // Error! `rc_examples` already moved into `rc_a`
    // And when `rc_a` is dropped, `rc_examples` is dropped together
    // println!("rc_examples: {}", rc_examples);
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line
}
```

# `Result`

We've seen that the `Option` enum can be used as a return value from functions
that may fail, where `None` can be returned to indicate failure. However,
sometimes it is important to express *why* an operation failed. To do this we
have the `Result` enum.

The `Result<T, E>` enum has two variants:

* `Ok(value)` which indicates that the operation succeeded, and wraps the
  `value` returned by the operation. (`value` has type `T`)
* `Err(why)`, which indicates that the operation failed, and wraps `why`,
  which (hopefully) explains the cause of the failure. (`why` has type `E`)

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
mod checked {
    // Mathematical "errors" we want to catch
    #[derive(Debug)]
    pub enum MathError {
        DivisionByZero,
        NonPositiveLogarithm,
        NegativeSquareRoot,
    }

    pub type MathResult = Result<f64, MathError>;

    pub fn div(x: f64, y: f64) -> MathResult {
        if y == 0.0 {
            // This operation would `fail`, instead let's return the reason of
            // the failure wrapped in `Err`
            Err(MathError::DivisionByZero)
        } else {
            // This operation is valid, return the result wrapped in `Ok`
            Ok(x / y)
        }
    }

    pub fn sqrt(x: f64) -> MathResult {
        if x < 0.0 {
            Err(MathError::NegativeSquareRoot)
        } else {
            Ok(x.sqrt())
        }
    }

    pub fn ln(x: f64) -> MathResult {
        if x <= 0.0 {
            Err(MathError::NonPositiveLogarithm)
        } else {
            Ok(x.ln())
        }
    }
}

// `op(x, y)` === `sqrt(ln(x / y))`
fn op(x: f64, y: f64) -> f64 {
    // This is a three level match pyramid!
    match checked::div(x, y) {
        Err(why) => panic!("{:?}", why),
        Ok(ratio) => match checked::ln(ratio) {
            Err(why) => panic!("{:?}", why),
            Ok(ln) => match checked::sqrt(ln) {
                Err(why) => panic!("{:?}", why),
                Ok(sqrt) => sqrt,
            },
        },
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Will this fail?
    println!("{}", op(1.0, 10.0));
}
```

# Strings

The two most used string types in Rust are `String` and `&str`.

A `String` is stored as a vector of bytes (`Vec<u8>`), but guaranteed to
always be a valid UTF-8 sequence. `String` is heap allocated, growable and not
null terminated.

`&str` is a slice (`&[u8]`) that always points to a valid UTF-8 sequence, and
can be used to view into a `String`, just like `&[T]` is a view into `Vec<T>`.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    // (all the type annotations are superfluous)
    // A reference to a string allocated in read only memory
    let pangram: &'static str = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
    println!("Pangram: {}", pangram);

    // Iterate over words in reverse, no new string is allocated
    println!("Words in reverse");
    for word in pangram.split_whitespace().rev() {
        println!("> {}", word);
    }

    // Copy chars into a vector, sort and remove duplicates
    let mut chars: Vec<char> = pangram.chars().collect();
    chars.sort();
    chars.dedup();

    // Create an empty and growable `String`
    let mut string = String::new();
    for c in chars {
        // Insert a char at the end of string
        string.push(c);
        // Insert a string at the end of string
        string.push_str(", ");
    }

    // The trimmed string is a slice to the original string, hence no new
    // allocation is performed
    let chars_to_trim: &[char] = &[' ', ','];
    let trimmed_str: &str = string.trim_matches(chars_to_trim);
    println!("Used characters: {}", trimmed_str);

    // Heap allocate a string
    let alice = String::from("I like dogs");
    // Allocate new memory and store the modified string there
    let bob: String = alice.replace("dog", "cat");

    println!("Alice says: {}", alice);
    println!("Bob says: {}", bob);
}
```

More `str`/`String` methods can be found under the
[std::str][str] and
[std::string][string]
modules

## Literals and escapes

There are multiple ways to write string literals with special characters in them.
All result in a similar `&str` so it's best to use the form that is the most
convenient to write. Similarly there are multiple ways to write byte string literals,
which all result in `&[u8; N]`.

Generally special characters are escaped with a backslash character: `\`.
This way you can add any character to your string, even unprintable ones
and ones that you don't know how to type. If you want a literal backslash,
escape it with another one: `\\`

String or character literal delimiters occurring within a literal must be escaped: `"\""`, `'\''`.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    // You can use escapes to write bytes by their hexadecimal values...
    let byte_escape = "I'm writing \x52\x75\x73\x74!";
    println!("What are you doing\x3F (\\x3F means ?) {}", byte_escape);

    // ...or Unicode code points.
    let unicode_codepoint = "\u{211D}";
    let character_name = "\"DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL R\"";

    println!("Unicode character {} (U+211D) is called {}",
                unicode_codepoint, character_name );


    let long_string = "String literals
                        can span multiple lines.
                        The linebreak and indentation here ->\
                        <- can be escaped too!";
    println!("{}", long_string);
}
```

Sometimes there are just too many characters that need to be escaped or it's just
much more convenient to write a string out as-is. This is where raw string literals come into play.

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let raw_str = r"Escapes don't work here: \x3F \u{211D}";
    println!("{}", raw_str);

    // If you need quotes in a raw string, add a pair of #s
    let quotes = r#"And then I said: "There is no escape!""#;
    println!("{}", quotes);

    // If you need "# in your string, just use more #s in the delimiter.
    // You can use up to 255 #s.
    let longer_delimiter = r###"A string with "# in it. And even "##!"###;
    println!("{}", longer_delimiter);
}
```

Want a string that's not UTF-8? (Remember, `str` and `String` must be valid UTF-8).
Or maybe you want an array of bytes that's mostly text? Byte strings to the rescue!

```rust, editable
use std::str;

fn main() {
    // Note that this is not actually a `&str`
    let bytestring: &[u8; 21] = b"this is a byte string";

    // Byte arrays don't have the `Display` trait, so printing them is a bit limited
    println!("A byte string: {:?}", bytestring);

    // Byte strings can have byte escapes...
    let escaped = b"\x52\x75\x73\x74 as bytes";
    // ...but no unicode escapes
    // let escaped = b"\u{211D} is not allowed";
    println!("Some escaped bytes: {:?}", escaped);


    // Raw byte strings work just like raw strings
    let raw_bytestring = br"\u{211D} is not escaped here";
    println!("{:?}", raw_bytestring);

    // Converting a byte array to `str` can fail
    if let Ok(my_str) = str::from_utf8(raw_bytestring) {
        println!("And the same as text: '{}'", my_str);
    }

    let _quotes = br#"You can also use "fancier" formatting, \
                    like with normal raw strings"#;

    // Byte strings don't have to be UTF-8
    let shift_jis = b"\x82\xe6\x82\xa8\x82\xb1\x82\xbb"; // "ようこそ" in SHIFT-JIS

    // But then they can't always be converted to `str`
    match str::from_utf8(shift_jis) {
        Ok(my_str) => println!("Conversion successful: '{}'", my_str),
        Err(e) => println!("Conversion failed: {:?}", e),
    };
}
```

# Vectors

Vectors are re-sizable arrays. Like slices, their size is not known at compile
time, but they can grow or shrink at any time. A vector is represented using
3 parameters:

- pointer to the data
- length
- capacity

The capacity indicates how much memory is reserved for the vector. The vector
can grow as long as the length is smaller than the capacity. When this threshold
needs to be surpassed, the vector is reallocated with a larger capacity.

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
fn main() {
    // Iterators can be collected into vectors
    let collected_iterator: Vec<i32> = (0..10).collect();
    println!("Collected (0..10) into: {:?}", collected_iterator);

    // The `vec!` macro can be used to initialize a vector
    let mut xs = vec![1i32, 2, 3];
    println!("Initial vector: {:?}", xs);

    // Insert new element at the end of the vector
    println!("Push 4 into the vector");
    xs.push(4);
    println!("Vector: {:?}", xs);

    // Error! Immutable vectors can't grow
    collected_iterator.push(0);
    // FIXME ^ Comment out this line

    // The `len` method yields the number of elements currently stored in a vector
    println!("Vector length: {}", xs.len());

    // Indexing is done using the square brackets (indexing starts at 0)
    println!("Second element: {}", xs[1]);

    // `pop` removes the last element from the vector and returns it
    println!("Pop last element: {:?}", xs.pop());

    // Out of bounds indexing yields a panic
    println!("Fourth element: {}", xs[3]);
    // FIXME ^ Comment out this line

    // `Vector`s can be easily iterated over
    println!("Contents of xs:");
    for x in xs.iter() {
        println!("> {}", x);
    }

    // A `Vector` can also be iterated over while the iteration
    // count is enumerated in a separate variable (`i`)
    for (i, x) in xs.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("In position {} we have value {}", i, x);
    }

    // Thanks to `iter_mut`, mutable `Vector`s can also be iterated
    // over in a way that allows modifying each value
    for x in xs.iter_mut() {
        *x *= 3;
    }
    println!("Updated vector: {:?}", xs);
}

# Alternate/custom key types

Any type that implements the `Eq` and `Hash` traits can be a key in `HashMap`.
This includes:

* `bool` (though not very useful since there are only two possible keys)
* `int`, `uint`, and all variations thereof
* `String` and `&str` (protip: you can have a `HashMap` keyed by `String`
and call `.get()` with an `&str`)

Note that `f32` and `f64` do *not* implement `Hash`,
likely because [floating-point precision errors][floating]
would make using them as hashmap keys horribly error-prone.

All collection classes implement `Eq` and `Hash`
if their contained type also respectively implements `Eq` and `Hash`.
For example, `Vec<T>` will implement `Hash` if `T` implements `Hash`.

You can easily implement `Eq` and `Hash` for a custom type with just one line:
`#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]`

The compiler will do the rest. If you want more control over the details,
you can implement `Eq` and/or `Hash` yourself.
This guide will not cover the specifics of implementing `Hash`.

To play around with using a `struct` in `HashMap`,
let's try making a very simple user logon system:

```rust,editable
use std::collections::HashMap;

// Eq requires that you derive PartialEq on the type.
#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
struct Account<'a>{
    username: &'a str,
    password: &'a str,
}

struct AccountInfo<'a>{
    name: &'a str,
    email: &'a str,
}

type Accounts<'a> = HashMap<Account<'a>, AccountInfo<'a>>;

fn try_logon<'a>(accounts: &Accounts<'a>,
        username: &'a str, password: &'a str){
    println!("Username: {}", username);
    println!("Password: {}", password);
    println!("Attempting logon...");

    let logon = Account {
        username,
        password,
    };

    match accounts.get(&logon) {
        Some(account_info) => {
            println!("Successful logon!");
            println!("Name: {}", account_info.name);
            println!("Email: {}", account_info.email);
        },
        _ => println!("Login failed!"),
    }
}

fn main(){
    let mut accounts: Accounts = HashMap::new();

    let account = Account {
        username: "j.everyman",
        password: "password123",
    };

    let account_info = AccountInfo {
        name: "John Everyman",
        email: "j.everyman@email.com",
    };

    accounts.insert(account, account_info);

    try_logon(&accounts, "j.everyman", "psasword123");

    try_logon(&accounts, "j.everyman", "password123");
}
```

# HashSet

Consider a `HashSet` as a `HashMap` where we just care about the keys (
`HashSet<T>` is, in actuality, just a wrapper around `HashMap<T, ()>`).

"What's the point of that?" you ask. "I could just store the keys in a `Vec`."

A `HashSet`'s unique feature is that
it is guaranteed to not have duplicate elements.
That's the contract that any set collection fulfills.
`HashSet` is just one implementation. (see also: [`BTreeSet`][treeset])

If you insert a value that is already present in the `HashSet`,
(i.e. the new value is equal to the existing and they both have the same hash),
then the new value will replace the old.

This is great for when you never want more than one of something,
or when you want to know if you've already got something.

But sets can do more than that.

Sets have 4 primary operations (all of the following calls return an iterator):

* `union`: get all the unique elements in both sets.

* `difference`: get all the elements that are in the first set but not the second.

* `intersection`: get all the elements that are only in *both* sets.

* `symmetric_difference`:
get all the elements that are in one set or the other, but *not* both.

Try all of these in the following example:

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
use std::collections::HashSet;

fn main() {
    let mut a: HashSet<i32> = vec![1i32, 2, 3].into_iter().collect();
    let mut b: HashSet<i32> = vec![2i32, 3, 4].into_iter().collect();

    assert!(a.insert(4));
    assert!(a.contains(&4));

    // `HashSet::insert()` returns false if
    // there was a value already present.
    assert!(b.insert(4), "Value 4 is already in set B!");
    // FIXME ^ Comment out this line

    b.insert(5);

    // If a collection's element type implements `Debug`,
    // then the collection implements `Debug`.
    // It usually prints its elements in the format `[elem1, elem2, ...]`

    // Print [2, 3, 4] in arbitrary order.
    println!("Intersection: {:?}", a.intersection(&b).collect::<Vec<&i32>>());

    // Print [1, 5]
    println!("Symmetric Difference: {:?}",
             a.symmetric_difference(&b).collect::<Vec<&i32>>());

# `?`

Chaining results using match can get pretty untidy; luckily, the `?` operator
can be used to make things pretty again. `?` is used at the end of an expression
returning a `Result`, and is equivalent to a match expression, where the
`Err(err)` branch expands to an early `return Err(From::from(err))`, and the `Ok(ok)`
branch expands to an `ok` expression.

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
mod checked {
    #[derive(Debug)]
    enum MathError {
        DivisionByZero,
        NonPositiveLogarithm,
        NegativeSquareRoot,
    }

    type MathResult = Result<f64, MathError>;

    fn div(x: f64, y: f64) -> MathResult {
        if y == 0.0 {
            Err(MathError::DivisionByZero)
        } else {
            Ok(x / y)
        }
    }

    fn sqrt(x: f64) -> MathResult {
        if x < 0.0 {
            Err(MathError::NegativeSquareRoot)
        } else {
            Ok(x.sqrt())
        }
    }

    fn ln(x: f64) -> MathResult {
        if x <= 0.0 {
            Err(MathError::NonPositiveLogarithm)
        } else {
            Ok(x.ln())
        }
    }

    // Intermediate function
    fn op_(x: f64, y: f64) -> MathResult {
        // if `div` "fails", then `DivisionByZero` will be `return`ed
        let ratio = div(x, y)?;

        // if `ln` "fails", then `NonPositiveLogarithm` will be `return`ed
        let ln = ln(ratio)?;

        sqrt(ln)
    }

    pub fn op(x: f64, y: f64) {
        match op_(x, y) {
            Err(why) => panic!("{}", match why {
                MathError::NonPositiveLogarithm

        }
    }

Be sure to check the [documentation][docs],
as there are many methods to map/compose `Result`.

# Program arguments

## Standard Library

The command line arguments can be accessed using `std::env::args`, which
returns an iterator that yields a `String` for each argument:

```rust,editable
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    // The first argument is the path that was used to call the program.
    println!("My path is {}.", args[0]);

    // The rest of the arguments are the passed command line parameters.
    // Call the program like this:
    //   $ ./args arg1 arg2
    println!("I got {:?} arguments: {:?}.", args.len() - 1, &args[1..]);
}
```

```shell
$ ./args 1 2 3
My path is ./args.
I got 3 arguments: ["1", "2", "3"].
```

## Crates

Alternatively, there are numerous crates that can provide extra functionality
when creating command-line applications. One of the more popular command line
argument crates being [`clap`].

# Channels

Rust provides asynchronous `channels` for communication between threads. Channels
allow a unidirectional flow of information between two end-points: the
`Sender` and the `Receiver`.

```rust,editable
use std::sync::mpsc::{Sender, Receiver};
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

static NTHREADS: i32 = 3;

fn main() {
    // Channels have two endpoints: the `Sender<T>` and the `Receiver<T>`,
    // where `T` is the type of the message to be transferred
    // (type annotation is superfluous)
    let (tx, rx): (Sender<i32>, Receiver<i32>) = mpsc::channel();
    let mut children = Vec::new();

    for id in 0..NTHREADS {
        // The sender endpoint can be copied
        let thread_tx = tx.clone();

        // Each thread will send its id via the channel
        let child = thread::spawn(move || {
            // The thread takes ownership over `thread_tx`
            // Each thread queues a message in the channel
            thread_tx.send(id).unwrap();

            // Sending is a non-blocking operation, the thread will continue
            // immediately after sending its message
            println!("thread {} finished", id);
        });

        children.push(child);
    }

    // Here, all the messages are collected
    let mut ids = Vec::with_capacity(NTHREADS as usize);
    for _ in 0..NTHREADS {
        // The `recv` method picks a message from the channel
        // `recv` will block the current thread if there are no messages available
        ids.push(rx.recv());
    }

    // Wait for the threads to complete any remaining work
    for child in children {
        child.join().expect("oops! the child thread panicked");
    }

    // Show the order in which the messages were sent
    println!("{:?}", ids);
}
```

# Foreign Function Interface

Rust provides a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) to C libraries. Foreign
functions must be declared inside an `extern` block annotated with a `#[link]`
attribute containing the name of the foreign library.

```rust,ignore
use std::fmt;

// this extern block links to the libm library
#[cfg(target_family = "windows")]
#[link(name = "msvcrt")]
extern {
    // this is a foreign function
    // that computes the square root of a single precision complex number
    fn csqrtf(z: Complex) -> Complex;

    fn ccosf(z: Complex) -> Complex;
}
#[cfg(target_family = "unix")]
#[link(name = "m")]
extern {
    // this is a foreign function
    // that computes the square root of a single precision complex number
    fn csqrtf(z: Complex) -> Complex;

    fn ccosf(z: Complex) -> Complex;
}

// Since calling foreign functions is considered unsafe,
// it's common to write safe wrappers around them.
fn cos(z: Complex) -> Complex {
    unsafe { ccosf(z) }
}

fn main() {
    // z = -1 + 0i
    let z = Complex { re: -1., im: 0. };

    // calling a foreign function is an unsafe operation
    let z_sqrt = unsafe { csqrtf(z) };

    println!("the square root of {:?} is {:?}", z, z_sqrt);

    // calling safe API wrapped around unsafe operation
    println!("cos({:?}) = {:?}", z, cos(z));
}

// Minimal implementation of single precision complex numbers
#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct Complex {
    re: f32,
    im: f32,
}

impl fmt::Debug for Complex {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        if self.im < 0. {
            write!(f, "{}-{}i", self.re, -self.im)
        } else {
            write!(f, "{}+{}i", self.re, self.im)

# File I/O

The `File` struct represents a file that has been opened (it wraps a file
descriptor), and gives read and/or write access to the underlying file.

Since many things can go wrong when doing file I/O, all the `File` methods
return the `io::Result<T>` type, which is an alias for `Result<T, io::Error>`.

This makes the failure of all I/O operations *explicit*. Thanks to this, the
programmer can see all the failure paths, and is encouraged to handle them in
a proactive manner.

# Filesystem Operations

The `std::fs` module contains several functions that deal with the filesystem.

```rust,ignore

fn cat(path: &Path) -> io::Result<String> {
    let mut f = File::open(path)?;
    let mut s = String::new();
    match f.read_to_string(&mut s) {
        Ok(_) => Ok(s),
        Err(e) => Err(e),

}

// A simple implementation of `% echo s > path`
fn echo(s: &str, path: &Path) -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut f = File::create(path)?;

    f.write_all(s.as_bytes())
}

// A simple implementation of `% touch path` (ignores existing files)
fn touch(path: &Path) -> io::Result<()> {
    match OpenOptions::new().create(true).write(true).open(path) {
        Ok(_) => Ok(()),
        Err(e) => Err(e),
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!("`mkdir a`");
    // Create a directory, returns `io::Result<()>`
    match fs::create_dir("a") {
        Err(why) => println!("! {:?}", why.kind()),
        Ok(_) => {},
    }

    println!("`echo hello > a/b.txt`");
    // The previous match can be simplified using the `unwrap_or_else` method
    echo("hello", &Path::new("a/b.txt")).unwrap_or_else(|why| {
        println!("! {:?}", why.kind());
    });

    println!("`mkdir -p a/c/d`");
    // Recursively create a directory, returns `io::Result<()>`
    fs::create_dir_all("a/c/d").unwrap_or_else(|why| {
        println!("! {:?}", why.kind());
    });

    println!("`touch a/c/e.txt`");
    touch(&Path::new("a/c/e.txt")).unwrap_or_else(|why| {
        println!("! {:?}", why.kind());
    });

    println!("`ln -s ../b.txt a/c/b.txt`");
    // Create a symbolic link, returns `io::Result<()>`
    #[cfg(target_family = "unix")] {
        unix::fs::symlink("../b.txt", "a/c/b.txt").unwrap_or_else(|why| {

        });
    }
    #[cfg(target_family = "windows")] {
        windows::fs::symlink_file("../b.txt", "a/c/b.txt").unwrap_or_else(|why| {
            println!("! {:?}", why.to_string());
        });
    }

    println!("`cat a/c/b.txt`");
    match cat(&Path::new("a/c/b.txt")) {
        Err(why) => println!("! {:?}", why.kind()),
        Ok(s) => println!("> {}", s),
    }

    println!("`ls a`");
    // Read the contents of a directory, returns `io::Result<Vec<Path>>`
    match fs::read_dir("a") {
        Err(why) => println!("! {:?}", why.kind()),
        Ok(paths) => for path in paths {
            println!("> {:?}", path.unwrap().path());
        },
    }

    println!("`rm a/c/e.txt`");
    // Remove a file, returns `io::Result<()>`
    fs::remove_file("a/c/e.txt").unwrap_or_else(|why| {
        println!("! {:?}", why.kind());
    });

    println!("`rmdir a/c/d`");
    // Remove an empty directory, returns `io::Result<()>`
    fs::remove_dir("a/c/d").unwrap_or_else(|why| {
        println!("! {:?}", why.kind());
    });
}
```

Here's the expected successful output:

```shell
$ rustc fs.rs && ./fs
`mkdir a`
`echo hello > a/b.txt`
`mkdir -p a/c/d`
`touch a/c/e.txt`
`ln -s ../b.txt a/c/b.txt`
`cat a/c/b.txt`
> hello
`ls a`
> "a/b.txt"
> "a/c"
`rm a/c/e.txt`
`rmdir a/c/d`
```

And the final state of the `a` directory is:

```shell
$ tree a
a
|-- b.txt
`-- c
    `-- b.txt -> ../b.txt

1 directory, 2 files
```

An alternative way to define the function `cat` is with `?` notation:

```rust,ignore
fn cat(path: &Path) -> io::Result<String> {
    let mut f = File::open(path)?;
    let mut s = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&mut s)?;
    Ok(s)
}
```

# Path

The `Path` struct represents file paths in the underlying filesystem. There are
two flavors of `Path`: `posix::Path`, for UNIX-like systems, and
`windows::Path`, for Windows. The prelude exports the appropriate
platform-specific `Path` variant.

A `Path` can be created from an `OsStr`, and provides several methods to get
information from the file/directory the path points to.

A `Path` is immutable. The owned version of `Path` is `PathBuf`. The relation
between `Path` and `PathBuf` is similar to that of `str` and `String`:
a `PathBuf` can be mutated in-place, and can be dereferenced to a `Path`.

Note that a `Path` is *not* internally represented as an UTF-8 string, but
instead is stored as an `OsString`. Therefore, converting a `Path` to a `&str`
is *not* free and may fail (an `Option` is returned). However, a `Path` can be
freely converted to an `OsString` or `&OsStr` using `into_os_string` and
`as_os_str`, respectively.

```rust,editable
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    // Create a `Path` from an `&'static str`
    let path = Path::new(".");

    // The `display` method returns a `Display`able structure
    let _display = path.display();

    // `join` merges a path with a byte container using the OS specific
    // separator, and returns a `PathBuf`
    let mut new_path = path.join("a").join("b");

    // `push` extends the `PathBuf` with a `&Path`
    new_path.push("c");
    new_path.push("myfile.tar.gz");

    // `set_file_name` updates the file name of the `PathBuf`
    new_path.set_file_name("package.tgz");

    // Convert the `PathBuf` into a string slice
    match new_path.to_str() {
        None => panic!("new path is not a valid UTF-8 sequence"),
        Some(s) => println!("new path is {}", s),
    }
}
```

Be sure to check at other `Path` methods (`posix::Path` or `windows::Path`) and
the `Metadata` struct.

FILE: src/std_misc/process.md
================================================
# Child processes

The `process::Output` struct represents the output of a finished child process,
and the `process::Command` struct is a process builder.

```rust,editable,ignore
use std::process::Command;

fn main() {
    let output = Command::new("rustc")
        .arg("--version")
        .output().unwrap_or_else(|e| {
            panic!("failed to execute process: {}", e)
    });

    if output.status.success() {
        let s = String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout);

        print!("rustc succeeded and stdout was:\n{}", s);
    } else {
        let s = String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stderr);

        print!("rustc failed and stderr was:\n{}", s);
    }
}
```

(You are encouraged to try the previous example with an incorrect flag passed
to `rustc`)

# Threads

Rust provides a mechanism for spawning native OS threads via the `spawn`
function, the argument of this function is a moving closure.

```rust,editable
use std::thread;

const NTHREADS: u32 = 10;

// This is the `main` thread
fn main() {
    // Make a vector to hold the children which are spawned.
    let mut children = vec![];

    for i in 0..NTHREADS {
        // Spin up another thread
        children.push(thread::spawn(move || {
            println!("this is thread number {}", i);
        }));
    }

    for child in children {
        // Wait for the thread to finish. Returns a result.
        let _ = child.join();
    }
}
```

These threads will be scheduled by the OS.

(As in the previous example, you are encouraged to test this example under
failure conditions.)

The [`OpenOptions`] struct can be used to configure how a file is opened.

[`OpenOptions`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/struct.OpenOptions.html



================================================
FILE: src/std_misc/file/open.md
================================================
# `open`

The `open` function can be used to open a file in read-only mode.

A `File` owns a resource, the file descriptor and takes care of closing the
file when it is `drop`ed.

```rust,editable,ignore
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    // Create a path to the desired file
    let path = Path::new("hello.txt");
    let display = path.display();

    // Open the path in read-only mode, returns `io::Result<File>`
    let mut file = match File::open(&path) {
        Err(why) => panic!("couldn't open {}: {}", display, why),
        Ok(file) => file,
    };

    // Read the file contents into a string, returns `io::Result<usize>`
    let mut s = String::new();
    match file.read_to_string(&mut s) {
        Err(why) => panic!("couldn't read {}: {}", display, why),
        Ok(_) => print!("{} contains:\n{}", display, s),
    }

    // `file` goes out of scope, and the "hello.txt" file gets closed
}
```

Here's the expected successful output:

```shell
$ echo "Hello World!" > hello.txt
$ rustc open.rs && ./open
hello.txt contains:
Hello World!
```

(You are encouraged to test the previous example under different failure
conditions: `hello.txt` doesn't exist, or `hello.txt` is not readable,
etc.)



================================================
FILE: src/std_misc/file/read_lines.md
================================================
# `read_lines`

## A naive approach

This might be a reasonable first attempt for a beginner's first
implementation for reading lines from a file.

```rust,no_run
use std::fs::read_to_string;

fn read_lines(filename: &str) -> Vec<String> {
    let mut result = Vec::new();

    for line in read_to_string(filename).unwrap().lines() {
        result.push(line.to_string())
    }

    result
}
```

Since the method `lines()` returns an iterator over the lines in the file,
we can also perform a map inline and collect the results, yielding a more
concise and fluent expression.

```rust,no_run
use std::fs::read_to_string;

fn read_lines(filename: &str) -> Vec<String> {
    read_to_string(filename)
        .unwrap()  // panic on possible file-reading errors
        .lines()  // split the string into an iterator of string slices
        .map(String::from)  // make each slice into a string
        .collect()  // gather them together into a vector
}
```

Note that in both examples above, we must convert the `&str` reference
returned from `lines()` to the owned type `String`, using `.to_string()`
and `String::from` respectively.

## A more efficient approach

Here we pass ownership of the open `File` to a `BufReader` struct. `BufReader` uses an internal
buffer to reduce intermediate allocations.

We also update `read_lines` to return an iterator instead of allocating new
`String` objects in memory for each line.

```rust,no_run
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, BufRead};
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    // File hosts.txt must exist in the current path
    if let Ok(lines) = read_lines("./hosts.txt") {
        // Consumes the iterator, returns an (Optional) String
        for line in lines.map_while(Result::ok) {
            println!("{}", line);
        }
    }
}

// The output is wrapped in a Result to allow matching on errors.
// Returns an Iterator to the Reader of the lines of the file.
fn read_lines<P>(filename: P) -> io::Result<io::Lines<io::BufReader<File>>>
where P: AsRef<Path>, {
    let file = File::open(filename)?;
    Ok(io::BufReader::new(file).lines())
}
```

Running this program simply prints the lines individually.

```shell
$ echo -e "127.0.0.1\n192.168.0.1\n" > hosts.txt
$ rustc read_lines.rs && ./read_lines
127.0.0.1
192.168.0.1
```

(Note that since `File::open` expects a generic `AsRef<Path>` as argument, we define our
generic `read_lines()` method with the same generic constraint, using the `where` keyword.)

This process is more efficient than creating a `String` in memory with all of the file's
contents. This can especially cause performance issues when working with larger files.



================================================
FILE: src/std_misc/process/pipe.md
================================================
# Pipes

The `std::process::Child` struct represents a child process, and exposes the
`stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` handles for interaction with the underlying
process via pipes.

```rust,ignore
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::process::{Command, Stdio};

static PANGRAM: &'static str =
"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n";

fn main() {
    // Spawn the `wc` command
    let mut cmd = if cfg!(target_family = "windows") {
        let mut cmd = Command::new("powershell");
        cmd.arg("-Command").arg("$input | Measure-Object -Line -Word -Character");
        cmd
    } else {
        Command::new("wc")
    };
    let process = match cmd
                                .stdin(Stdio::piped())
                                .stdout(Stdio::piped())
                                .spawn() {
        Err(why) => panic!("couldn't spawn wc: {}", why),
        Ok(process) => process,
    };

    // Write a string to the `stdin` of `wc`.
    //
    // `stdin` has type `Option<ChildStdin>`, but since we know this instance
    // must have one, we can directly `unwrap` it.
    match process.stdin.unwrap().write_all(PANGRAM.as_bytes()) {
        Err(why) => panic!("couldn't write to wc stdin: {}", why),
        Ok(_) => println!("sent pangram to wc"),
    }

    // Because `stdin` does not live after the above calls, it is `drop`ed,
    // and the pipe is closed.
    //
    // This is very important, otherwise `wc` wouldn't start processing the
    // input we just sent.

    // The `stdout` field also has type `Option<ChildStdout>` so must be unwrapped.
    let mut s = String::new();
    match process.stdout.unwrap().read_to_string(&mut s) {
        Err(why) => panic!("couldn't read wc stdout: {}", why),
        Ok(_) => print!("wc responded with:\n{}", s),
    }
}
```

FILE: src/std_misc/process/wait.md
================================================
# Wait

If you'd like to wait for a `process::Child` to finish, you must call
`Child::wait`, which will return a `process::ExitStatus`.

```rust,ignore
use std::process::Command;

fn main() {
    let mut child = Command::new("sleep").arg("5").spawn().unwrap();
    let _result = child.wait().unwrap();

    println!("reached end of main");
}
```

```bash
$ rustc wait.rs && ./wait
# `wait` keeps running for 5 seconds until the `sleep 5` command finishes
reached end of main
```

FILE: src/std_misc/threads/testcase_mapreduce.md
================================================
# Testcase: map-reduce

Rust makes it very easy to parallelize data processing, without many of the headaches traditionally associated with such an attempt.

The standard library provides great threading primitives out of the box.
These, combined with Rust's concept of Ownership and aliasing rules, automatically prevent
data races.

The aliasing rules (one writable reference XOR many readable references) automatically prevent
you from manipulating state that is visible to other threads. (Where synchronization is needed,
there are synchronization
primitives like `Mutex`es or `Channel`s.)

In this example, we will calculate the sum of all digits in a block of numbers.
We will do this by parcelling out chunks of the block into different threads. Each thread will sum
its tiny block of digits, and subsequently we will sum the intermediate sums produced by each
thread.

Note that, although we're passing references across thread boundaries, Rust understands that we're
only passing read-only references, and that thus no unsafety or data races can occur. Also because
the references we're passing have `'static` lifetimes, Rust understands that our data won't be
destroyed while these threads are still running. (When you need to share non-`static` data between
threads, you can use a smart pointer like `Arc` to keep the data alive and avoid non-`static`
lifetimes.)

```rust,editable
use std::thread;

// This is the `main` thread
fn main() {

    // This is our data to process.
    // We will calculate the sum of all digits via a threaded map-reduce algorithm.
    // Each whitespace separated chunk will be handled in a different thread.
    //
    // TODO: see what happens to the output if you insert spaces!

### Assignments

It is not wise to let our number of threads depend on user inputted data.
What if the user decides to insert a lot of spaces? Do we _really_ want to spawn 2,000 threads?
Modify the program so that the data is always chunked into a limited number of chunks,
defined by a static constant at the beginning of the program.

# Development dependencies

Sometimes there is a need to have dependencies for tests (or examples,
or benchmarks) only. Such dependencies are added to `Cargo.toml` in the
`[dev-dependencies]` section. These dependencies are not propagated to other
packages which depend on this package.

One such example is [`pretty_assertions`](https://docs.rs/pretty_assertions/1.0.0/pretty_assertions/index.html), which extends standard `assert_eq!` and `assert_ne!` macros, to provide colorful diff.
File `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
# standard crate data is left out
[dev-dependencies]
pretty_assertions = "1"
```

File `src/lib.rs`:

```rust,ignore
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use pretty_assertions::assert_eq; // crate for test-only use. Cannot be used in non-test code.

    #[test]
    fn test_add() {
        assert_eq!(add(2, 3), 5);
    }
}
```

================================================
# Documentation testing

The primary way of documenting a Rust project is through annotating the source
code. Documentation comments are written in
[CommonMark Markdown specification][commonmark] and support code blocks in them.
Rust takes care about correctness, so these code blocks are compiled and used
as documentation tests.

```rust,ignore
/// First line is a short summary describing function.
///
/// The next lines present detailed documentation. Code blocks start with
/// triple backquotes and have implicit `fn main()` inside
/// and `extern crate <cratename>`. Assume we're testing a `playground` library
/// crate or using the Playground's Test action:
///
/// ```
/// let result = playground::add(2, 3);
/// assert_eq!(result, 5);
/// ```
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

/// Usually doc comments may include sections "Examples", "Panics" and "Failures".
///
/// The next function divides two numbers.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let result = playground::div(10, 2);
/// assert_eq!(result, 5);
/// ```
///
/// # Panics
///
/// The function panics if the second argument is zero.
///
/// ```rust,should_panic
/// // panics on division by zero
/// playground::div(10, 0);
/// ```
pub fn div(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    if b == 0 {
        panic!("Divide-by-zero error");
    }

    a / b
}
```

Code blocks in documentation are automatically tested
when running the regular `cargo test` command:

```shell
$ cargo test
running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out

   Doc-tests playground

running 3 tests
test src/lib.rs - add (line 7) ... ok
test src/lib.rs - div (line 21) ... ok
test src/lib.rs - div (line 31) ... ok

test result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

## Motivation behind documentation tests

The main purpose of documentation tests is to serve as examples that exercise
the functionality, which is one of the most important
[guidelines][question-instead-of-unwrap]. It allows using examples from docs as
complete code snippets. But using `?` makes compilation fail since `main`
returns `unit`. The ability to hide some source lines from documentation comes
to the rescue: one may write `fn try_main() -> Result<(), ErrorType>`, hide it
and `unwrap` it in hidden `main`. Sounds complicated? Here's an example:

```rust,ignore
/// Using hidden `try_main` in doc tests.
///
/// ```
/// # // hidden lines start with `#` symbol, but they're still compilable!
/// # fn try_main() -> Result<(), String> { // line that wraps the body shown in doc
/// let res = playground::try_div(10, 2)?;
/// # Ok(()) // returning from try_main
/// # }
/// # fn main() { // starting main that'll unwrap()
/// #    try_main().unwrap(); // calling try_main and unwrapping
/// #                         // so that test will panic in case of error
/// # }
/// ```
pub fn try_div(a: i32, b: i32) -> Result<i32, String> {
    if b == 0 {
        Err(String::from("Divide-by-zero"))
    } else {
        Ok(a / b)
    }
}
```

================================================
# Integration testing

[Unit tests][unit] are testing one module in isolation at a time: they're small
and can test private code. Integration tests are external to your crate and use
only its public interface in the same way any other code would. Their purpose is
to test that many parts of your library work correctly together.

Cargo looks for integration tests in `tests` directory next to `src`.

File `src/lib.rs`:

```rust,ignore
// Define this in a crate called `adder`.
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

File with test: `tests/integration_test.rs`:

```rust,ignore
#[test]
fn test_add() {
    assert_eq!(adder::add(3, 2), 5);
}
```

Running tests with `cargo test` command:

```shell
$ cargo test
running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out

     Running target/debug/deps/integration_test-bcd60824f5fbfe19

running 1 test
test test_add ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out

   Doc-tests adder

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

Each Rust source file in the `tests` directory is compiled as a separate crate. In
order to share some code between integration tests we can make a module with public
functions, importing and using it within tests.

File `tests/common/mod.rs`:

```rust,ignore
pub fn setup() {
    // some setup code, like creating required files/directories, starting
    // servers, etc.
}
```

File with test: `tests/integration_test.rs`

```rust,ignore
// importing common module.
mod common;

#[test]
fn test_add() {
    // using common code.
    common::setup();
    assert_eq!(adder::add(3, 2), 5);
}
```

Creating the module as `tests/common.rs` also works, but is not recommended
because the test runner will treat the file as a test crate and try to run tests
inside it.

[mod]: ../mod.md



================================================
FILE: src/testing/unit_testing.md
================================================
# Unit testing

Tests are Rust functions that verify that the non-test code is functioning in
the expected manner. The bodies of test functions typically perform some setup,
run the code we want to test, then assert whether the results are what we
expect.

Most unit tests go into a `tests` [mod][mod] with the `#[cfg(test)]` [attribute][attribute].
Test functions are marked with the `#[test]` attribute.

Tests fail when something in the test function [panics][panic]. There are some
helper [macros][macros]:

* `assert!(expression)` - panics if expression evaluates to `false`.
* `assert_eq!(left, right)` and `assert_ne!(left, right)` - testing left and
  right expressions for equality and inequality respectively.

```rust,ignore
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

// This is a really bad adding function, its purpose is to fail in this
// example.
#[allow(dead_code)]
fn bad_add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a - b
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    // Note this useful idiom: importing names from outer (for mod tests) scope.
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_add() {
        assert_eq!(add(1, 2), 3);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_bad_add() {
        // This assert would fire and test will fail.
        // Please note, that private functions can be tested too!
        assert_eq!(bad_add(1, 2), 3);
    }
}
```

Tests can be run with `cargo test`.

```shell
$ cargo test

running 2 tests
test tests::test_bad_add ... FAILED
test tests::test_add ... ok

failures:

---- tests::test_bad_add stdout ----
        thread 'tests::test_bad_add' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
  left: `-1`,
 right: `3`', src/lib.rs:21:8
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.


failures:
    tests::test_bad_add

test result: FAILED. 1 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

## Tests and `?`

None of the previous unit test examples had a return type. But in Rust 2018,
your unit tests can return `Result<()>`, which lets you use `?` in them! This
can make them much more concise.

```rust,editable
fn sqrt(number: f64) -> Result<f64, String> {
    if number >= 0.0 {
        Ok(number.powf(0.5))
    } else {
        Err("negative floats don't have square roots".to_owned())
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_sqrt() -> Result<(), String> {
        let x = 4.0;
        assert_eq!(sqrt(x)?.powf(2.0), x);
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

See ["The Edition Guide"][editionguide] for more details.

## Testing panics

To check functions that should panic under certain circumstances, use attribute
`#[should_panic]`. This attribute accepts optional parameter `expected = ` with
the text of the panic message. If your function can panic in multiple ways, it helps
make sure your test is testing the correct panic.

**Note**: Rust also allows a shorthand form `#[should_panic = "message"]`, which works
exactly like `#[should_panic(expected = "message")]`. Both are valid; the latter is more commonly
used and is considered more explicit.

```rust,ignore
pub fn divide_non_zero_result(a: u32, b: u32) -> u32 {
    if b == 0 {
        panic!("Divide-by-zero error");
    } else if a < b {
        panic!("Divide result is zero");
    }
    a / b
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_divide() {
        assert_eq!(divide_non_zero_result(10, 2), 5);
    }

    #[test]
    #[should_panic]
    fn test_any_panic() {
        divide_non_zero_result(1, 0);
    }

    #[test]
    #[should_panic(expected = "Divide result is zero")]
    fn test_specific_panic() {
        divide_non_zero_result(1, 10);
    }

    #[test]
    #[should_panic = "Divide result is zero"] // This also works
    fn test_specific_panic_shorthand() {
        divide_non_zero_result(1, 10);
    }
}
```

Running these tests gives us:

```shell
$ cargo test

running 4 tests
test tests::test_any_panic ... ok
test tests::test_divide ... ok
test tests::test_specific_panic ... ok
test tests::test_specific_panic_shorthand ... ok

test result: ok. 4 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out

   Doc-tests tmp-test-should-panic

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

## Running specific tests

To run specific tests one may specify the test name to `cargo test` command.

```shell
$ cargo test test_any_panic
running 1 test
test tests::test_any_panic ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 3 filtered out

   Doc-tests tmp-test-should-panic

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

To run multiple tests one may specify part of a test name that matches all the
tests that should be run.

```shell
$ cargo test panic
running 3 tests
test tests::test_any_panic ... ok
test tests::test_specific_panic ... ok
test tests::test_specific_panic_shorthand ... ok

test result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 1 filtered out

   Doc-tests tmp-test-should-panic

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

## Ignoring tests

Tests can be marked with the `#[ignore]` attribute to exclude some tests. Or to run
them with command `cargo test -- --ignored`

```rust,ignore
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_add() {
        assert_eq!(add(2, 2), 4);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_add_hundred() {
        assert_eq!(add(100, 2), 102);
        assert_eq!(add(2, 100), 102);
    }

    #[test]
    #[ignore]
    fn ignored_test() {
        assert_eq!(add(0, 0), 0);
    }
}
```

```shell
$ cargo test
running 3 tests
test tests::ignored_test ... ignored
test tests::test_add ... ok
test tests::test_add_hundred ... ok

test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 1 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out

   Doc-tests tmp-ignore

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out

$ cargo test -- --ignored
running 1 test
test tests::ignored_test ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out

   Doc-tests tmp-ignore

# Clone

When dealing with resources, the default behavior is to transfer them during
assignments or function calls. However, sometimes we need to make a
copy of the resource as well.

The [`Clone`][clone] trait helps us do exactly this. Most commonly, we can
use the `.clone()` method defined by the `Clone` trait.

```rust,editable
// A unit struct without resources
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
struct Unit;

// A tuple struct with resources that implements the `Clone` trait
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
struct Pair(Box<i32>, Box<i32>);

fn main() {
    // Instantiate `Unit`
    let unit = Unit;
    // Copy `Unit`, there are no resources to move
    let copied_unit = unit;

    // Both `Unit`s can be used independently
    println!("original: {:?}", unit);
    println!("copy: {:?}", copied_unit);

    // Instantiate `Pair`
    let pair = Pair(Box::new(1), Box::new(2));
    println!("original: {:?}", pair);

    // Move `pair` into `moved_pair`, moves resources
    let moved_pair = pair;
    println!("moved: {:?}", moved_pair);

    // Error! `pair` has lost its resources
    //println!("original: {:?}", pair);
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line

    // Clone `moved_pair` into `cloned_pair` (resources are included)
    let cloned_pair = moved_pair.clone();
    // Drop the moved original pair using std::mem::drop
    drop(moved_pair);

    // Error! `moved_pair` has been dropped
    //println!("moved and dropped: {:?}", moved_pair);
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line

    // The result from .clone() can still be used!
    println!("clone: {:?}", cloned_pair);
}
```

# Derive

The compiler is capable of providing basic implementations for some traits via
the `#[derive]` [attribute][attribute]. These traits can still be
manually implemented if a more complex behavior is required.

The following is a list of derivable traits:

* Comparison traits:
  [`Eq`][eq], [`PartialEq`][partial-eq], [`Ord`][ord], [`PartialOrd`][partial-ord].
* [`Clone`][clone], to create `T` from `&T` via a copy.
* [`Copy`][copy], to give a type 'copy semantics' instead of 'move semantics'.
* [`Hash`][hash], to compute a hash from `&T`.
* [`Default`][default], to create an empty instance of a data type.
* [`Debug`][debug], to format a value using the `{:?}` formatter.

```rust,editable
// `Centimeters`, a tuple struct that can be compared
#[derive(PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
struct Centimeters(f64);

// `Inches`, a tuple struct that can be printed
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Inches(i32);

impl Inches {
    fn to_centimeters(&self) -> Centimeters {
        let &Inches(inches) = self;

        Centimeters(inches as f64 * 2.54)
    }
}

// `Seconds`, a tuple struct with no additional attributes
struct Seconds(i32);

fn main() {
    let _one_second = Seconds(1);

    // Error: `Seconds` can't be printed; it doesn't implement the `Debug` trait
    //println!("One second looks like: {:?}", _one_second);
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line

    // Error: `Seconds` can't be compared; it doesn't implement the `PartialEq` trait
    //let _this_is_true = (_one_second == _one_second);
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line

    let foot = Inches(12);

    println!("One foot equals {:?}", foot);

    let meter = Centimeters(100.0);

    let cmp =
        if foot.to_centimeters() < meter {
            "smaller"
        } else {
            "bigger"
        };

    println!("One foot is {} than one meter.", cmp);
}
```

FILE: src/trait/disambiguating.md
================================================
# Disambiguating overlapping traits

A type can implement many different traits. What if two traits both require
the same name for a function? For example, many traits might have a method
named `get()`. They might even have different return types!

Good news: because each trait implementation gets its own `impl` block, it's
clear which trait's `get` method you're implementing.

What about when it comes time to _call_ those methods? To disambiguate between
them, we have to use Fully Qualified Syntax.

```rust,editable
trait UsernameWidget {
    // Get the selected username out of this widget
    fn get(&self) -> String;
}

trait AgeWidget {
    // Get the selected age out of this widget
    fn get(&self) -> u8;
}

// A form with both a UsernameWidget and an AgeWidget
struct Form {
    username: String,
    age: u8,
}

impl UsernameWidget for Form {
    fn get(&self) -> String {
        self.username.clone()
    }
}

impl AgeWidget for Form {
    fn get(&self) -> u8 {
        self.age
    }
}

fn main() {
    let form = Form {
        username: "rustacean".to_owned(),
        age: 28,
    };

    // If you uncomment this line, you'll get an error saying
    // "multiple `get` found". Because, after all, there are multiple methods
    // named `get`.
    // println!("{}", form.get());

    let username = <Form as UsernameWidget>::get(&form);
    assert_eq!("rustacean".to_owned(), username);
    let age = <Form as AgeWidget>::get(&form);
    assert_eq!(28, age);
}
```

FILE: src/trait/drop.md
================================================
# Drop

The [`Drop`][Drop] trait only has one method: `drop`, which is called automatically
when an object goes out of scope. The main use of the `Drop` trait is to free the
resources that the implementor instance owns.

`Box`, `Vec`, `String`, `File`, and `Process` are some examples of types that
implement the `Drop` trait to free resources. The `Drop` trait can also be
manually implemented for any custom data type.

The following example adds a print to console to the `drop` function to announce
when it is called.

```rust,editable
struct Droppable {
    name: &'static str,
}

// This trivial implementation of `drop` adds a print to console.
impl Drop for Droppable {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("> Dropping {}", self.name);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let _a = Droppable { name: "a" };

    // block A
    {
        let _b = Droppable { name: "b" };

        // block B
        {
            let _c = Droppable { name: "c" };
            let _d = Droppable { name: "d" };

            println!("Exiting block B");
        }
        println!("Just exited block B");

        println!("Exiting block A");
    }
    println!("Just exited block A");

    // Variable can be manually dropped using the `drop` function
    drop(_a);
    // TODO ^ Try commenting this line

    println!("end of the main function");

    // `_a` *won't* be `drop`ed again here, because it already has been
    // (manually) `drop`ed
}
```

For a more practical example, here's how the `Drop` trait can be used to automatically
clean up temporary files when they're no longer needed:

```rust,editable
use std::fs::File;
use std::path::PathBuf;

struct TempFile {
    file: File,
    path: PathBuf,
}

impl TempFile {
    fn new(path: PathBuf) -> std::io::Result<Self> {
        // Note: File::create() will overwrite existing files
        let file = File::create(&path)?;

        Ok(Self { file, path })
    }
}

// When TempFile is dropped:
// 1. First, our drop implementation will remove the file's name from the filesystem.
// 2. Then, File's drop will close the file, removing its underlying content from the disk.
impl Drop for TempFile {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        if let Err(e) = std::fs::remove_file(&self.path) {
            eprintln!("Failed to remove temporary file: {}", e);
        }
        println!("> Dropped temporary file: {:?}", self.path);
        // File's drop is implicitly called here because it is a field of this struct.
    }
}

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    // Create a new scope to demonstrate drop behavior
    {
        let temp = TempFile::new("test.txt".into())?;
        println!("Temporary file created");
        // File will be automatically cleaned up when temp goes out of scope
    }
    println!("End of scope - file should be cleaned up");

    // We can also manually drop if needed
    let temp2 = TempFile::new("another_test.txt".into())?;
    drop(temp2); // Explicitly drop the file
    println!("Manually dropped file");

    Ok(())
}
```

FILE: src/trait/dyn.md
================================================
# Returning Traits with `dyn`

The Rust compiler needs to know how much space every function's return type requires. This means all
your functions have to return a concrete type. Unlike other languages, if you have a trait like
`Animal`, you can't write a function that returns `Animal`, because its different implementations
will need different amounts of memory.

However, there's an easy workaround. Instead of returning a trait object directly, our functions
return a `Box` which _contains_ some `Animal`. A `box` is just a reference to some memory in the
heap. Because a reference has a statically-known size, and the compiler can guarantee it points to a
heap-allocated `Animal`, we can return a trait from our function!

Rust tries to be as explicit as possible whenever it allocates memory on the heap. So if your
function returns a pointer-to-trait-on-heap in this way, you need to write the return type with the
`dyn` keyword, e.g. `Box<dyn Animal>`.

```rust,editable
struct Sheep {}
struct Cow {}

trait Animal {
    // Instance method signature
    fn noise(&self) -> &'static str;
}

// Implement the `Animal` trait for `Sheep`.
impl Animal for Sheep {
    fn noise(&self) -> &'static str {
        "baaaaah!"
    }
}

// Implement the `Animal` trait for `Cow`.
impl Animal for Cow {
    fn noise(&self) -> &'static str {
        "moooooo!"
    }
}

// Returns some struct that implements Animal, but we don't know which one at compile time.
fn random_animal(random_number: f64) -> Box<dyn Animal> {
    if random_number < 0.5 {
        Box::new(Sheep {})
    } else {
        Box::new(Cow {})
    }
}

fn main() {
    let random_number = 0.234;
    let animal = random_animal(random_number);
    println!("You've randomly chosen an animal, and it says {}", animal.noise());
}

```

FILE: src/trait/impl_trait.md
================================================
# `impl Trait`

`impl Trait` can be used in two locations:

1. as an argument type
2. as a return type

## As an argument type

If your function is generic over a trait but you don't mind the specific type, you can simplify the function declaration using `impl Trait` as the type of the argument.

For example, consider the following code:

```rust,editable
fn parse_csv_document<R: std::io::BufRead>(src: R) -> std::io::Result<Vec<Vec<String>>> {
    src.lines()
        .map(|line| {
            // For each line in the source
            line.map(|line| {
                // If the line was read successfully, process it, if not, return the error
                line.split(',') // Split the line separated by commas
                    .map(|entry| String::from(entry.trim())) // Remove leading and trailing whitespace
                    .collect() // Collect all strings in a row into a Vec<String>
            })
        })
        .collect() // Collect all lines into a Vec<Vec<String>>
}
```

`parse_csv_document` is generic, allowing it to take any type which implements BufRead, such as `BufReader<File>` or `[u8]`,
but it's not important what type `R` is, and `R` is only used to declare the type of `src`, so the function can also be written as:

```rust,editable
fn parse_csv_document(src: impl std::io::BufRead) -> std::io::Result<Vec<Vec<String>>> {
    src.lines()
        .map(|line| {
            // For each line in the source
            line.map(|line| {
                // If the line was read successfully, process it, if not, return the error
                line.split(',') // Split the line separated by commas
                    .map(|entry| String::from(entry.trim())) // Remove leading and trailing whitespace
                    .collect() // Collect all strings in a row into a Vec<String>
            })
        })
        .collect() // Collect all lines into a Vec<Vec<String>>
}
```

Note that using `impl Trait` as an argument type means that you cannot explicitly state what form of the function you use, i.e. `parse_csv_document::<std::io::Empty>(std::io::empty())` will not work with the second example.

## As a return type

If your function returns a type that implements `MyTrait`, you can write its
return type as `-> impl MyTrait`. This can help simplify your type signatures quite a lot!

```rust,editable
use std::iter;
use std::vec::IntoIter;

// This function combines two `Vec<i32>` and returns an iterator over it.
// Look how complicated its return type is!
fn combine_vecs_explicit_return_type(
    v: Vec<i32>,
    u: Vec<i32>,
) -> iter::Cycle<iter::Chain<IntoIter<i32>, IntoIter<i32>>> {
    v.into_iter().chain(u.into_iter()).cycle()
}

// This is the exact same function, but its return type uses `impl Trait`.
// Look how much simpler it is!
fn combine_vecs(
    v: Vec<i32>,
    u: Vec<i32>,
) -> impl Iterator<Item=i32> {
    v.into_iter().chain(u.into_iter()).cycle()
}

fn main() {
    let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let v2 = vec![4, 5];
    let mut v3 = combine_vecs(v1, v2);
    assert_eq!(Some(1), v3.next());
    assert_eq!(Some(2), v3.next());
    assert_eq!(Some(3), v3.next());
    assert_eq!(Some(4), v3.next());
    assert_eq!(Some(5), v3.next());
    println!("all done");
}
```

More importantly, some Rust types can't be written out. For example, every
closure has its own unnamed concrete type. Before `impl Trait` syntax, you had
to allocate on the heap in order to return a closure. But now you can do it all
statically, like this:

```rust,editable
// Returns a function that adds `y` to its input
fn make_adder_function(y: i32) -> impl Fn(i32) -> i32 {
    let closure = move |x: i32| { x + y };
    closure
}

fn main() {
    let plus_one = make_adder_function(1);
    assert_eq!(plus_one(2), 3);
}
```

You can also use `impl Trait` to return an iterator that uses `map` or `filter`
closures! This makes using `map` and `filter` easier. Because closure types don't
have names, you can't write out an explicit return type if your function returns
iterators with closures. But with `impl Trait` you can do this easily:

```rust,editable
fn double_positives<'a>(numbers: &'a Vec<i32>) -> impl Iterator<Item = i32> + 'a {
    numbers
        .iter()
        .filter(|x| x > &&0)
        .map(|x| x * 2)
}

fn main() {
    let singles = vec![-3, -2, 2, 3];
    let doubles = double_positives(&singles);
    assert_eq!(doubles.collect::<Vec<i32>>(), vec![4, 6]);
}
```

# Iterators

The [`Iterator`][iter] trait is used to implement iterators over collections
such as arrays.

The trait requires only a method to be defined for the `next` element,
which may be manually defined in an `impl` block or automatically
defined (as in arrays and ranges).

As a point of convenience for common situations, the `for` construct
turns some collections into iterators using the [`.into_iter()`][intoiter] method.

```rust,editable
struct Fibonacci {
    curr: u32,
    next: u32,
}

// Implement `Iterator` for `Fibonacci`.
// The `Iterator` trait only requires a method to be defined for the `next` element,
// and an `associated type` to declare the return type of the iterator.
impl Iterator for Fibonacci {
    // We can refer to this type using Self::Item
    type Item = u32;

    // Here, we define the sequence using `.curr` and `.next`.
    // The return type is `Option<T>`:
    //     * When the `Iterator` is finished, `None` is returned.
    //     * Otherwise, the next value is wrapped in `Some` and returned.
    // We use Self::Item in the return type, so we can change
    // the type without having to update the function signatures.
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        let current = self.curr;

        self.curr = self.next;
        self.next = current + self.next;

        // Since there's no endpoint to a Fibonacci sequence, the `Iterator`
        // will never return `None`, and `Some` is always returned.
        Some(current)
    }
}

// Returns a Fibonacci sequence generator
fn fibonacci() -> Fibonacci {
    Fibonacci { curr: 0, next: 1 }
}

fn main() {
    // `0..3` is an `Iterator` that generates: 0, 1, and 2.
    let mut sequence = 0..3;

    println!("Four consecutive `next` calls on 0..3");
    println!("> {:?}", sequence.next());
    println!("> {:?}", sequence.next());
    println!("> {:?}", sequence.next());
    println!("> {:?}", sequence.next());

    // `for` works through an `Iterator` until it returns `None`.
    // Each `Some` value is unwrapped and bound to a variable (here, `i`).
    println!("Iterate through 0..3 using `for`");
    for i in 0..3 {
        println!("> {}", i);
    }

    // The `take(n)` method reduces an `Iterator` to its first `n` terms.
    println!("The first four terms of the Fibonacci sequence are: ");
    for i in fibonacci().take(4) {
        println!("> {}", i);
    }

    // The `skip(n)` method shortens an `Iterator` by dropping its first `n` terms.
    println!("The next four terms of the Fibonacci sequence are: ");
    for i in fibonacci().skip(4).take(4) {
        println!("> {}", i);
    }

    let array = [1u32, 3, 3, 7];

    // The `iter` method produces an `Iterator` over an array/slice.
    println!("Iterate the following array {:?}", &array);
    for i in array.iter() {
        println!("> {}", i);
    }

# Operator Overloading

In Rust, many of the operators can be overloaded via traits. That is, some operators can
be used to accomplish different tasks based on their input arguments. This is possible
because operators are syntactic sugar for method calls. For example, the `+` operator in
`a + b` calls the `add` method (as in `a.add(b)`). This `add` method is part of the `Add`
trait. Hence, the `+` operator can be used by any implementor of the `Add` trait.

A list of the traits, such as `Add`, that overload operators can be found in [`core::ops`][ops].

```rust,editable
use std::ops;

struct Foo;
struct Bar;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct FooBar;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct BarFoo;

// The `std::ops::Add` trait is used to specify the functionality of `+`.
// Here, we make `Add<Bar>` - the trait for addition with a RHS of type `Bar`.
// The following block implements the operation: Foo + Bar = FooBar
impl ops::Add<Bar> for Foo {
    type Output = FooBar;

    fn add(self, _rhs: Bar) -> FooBar {
        println!("> Foo.add(Bar) was called");

        FooBar
    }
}

// By reversing the types, we end up implementing non-commutative addition.
// Here, we make `Add<Foo>` - the trait for addition with a RHS of type `Foo`.
// This block implements the operation: Bar + Foo = BarFoo
impl ops::Add<Foo> for Bar {
    type Output = BarFoo;

    fn add(self, _rhs: Foo) -> BarFoo {
        println!("> Bar.add(Foo) was called");

        BarFoo
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!("Foo + Bar = {:?}", Foo + Bar);
    println!("Bar + Foo = {:?}", Bar + Foo);
}
```

# Supertraits

Rust doesn't have "inheritance", but you can define a trait as being a superset
of another trait. For example:

```rust,editable
trait Person {
    fn name(&self) -> String;
}

// Person is a supertrait of Student.
// Implementing Student requires you to also impl Person.
trait Student: Person {
    fn university(&self) -> String;
}

trait Programmer {
    fn fav_language(&self) -> String;
}

// CompSciStudent (computer science student) is a subtrait of both Programmer
// and Student. Implementing CompSciStudent requires you to impl both supertraits.
trait CompSciStudent: Programmer + Student {
    fn git_username(&self) -> String;
}

fn comp_sci_student_greeting(student: &dyn CompSciStudent) -> String {
    format!(
        "My name is {} and I attend {}. My favorite language is {}. My Git username is {}",
        student.name(),
        student.university(),
        student.fav_language(),
        student.git_username()
    )
}

fn main() {}
```

================================================
FILE: src/types/alias.md
================================================
# Aliasing

The `type` statement can be used to give a new name to an existing type. Types
must have `UpperCamelCase` names, or the compiler will raise a warning. The
exception to this rule are the primitive types: `usize`, `f32`, etc.

```rust,editable
// `NanoSecond`, `Inch`, and `U64` are new names for `u64`.
type NanoSecond = u64;
type Inch = u64;
type U64 = u64;

fn main() {
    // `NanoSecond` = `Inch` = `U64` = `u64`.
    let nanoseconds: NanoSecond = 5 as u64;
    let inches: Inch = 2 as U64;

    // Note that type aliases *don't* provide any extra type safety, because
    // aliases are *not* new types
    println!("{} nanoseconds + {} inches = {} unit?",
             nanoseconds,
             inches,
             nanoseconds + inches);
}
```

The main use of aliases is to reduce boilerplate; for example the `io::Result<T>` type
is an alias for the `Result<T, io::Error>` type.

FILE: src/types/cast.md
================================================
# Casting

Rust provides no implicit type conversion (coercion) between primitive types.
But, explicit type conversion (casting) can be performed using the `as` keyword.

Rules for converting between integral types follow C conventions generally,
except in cases where C has undefined behavior. The behavior of all casts
between integral types is well defined in Rust.

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
// Suppress all warnings from casts which overflow.
#![allow(overflowing_literals)]

fn main() {
    let decimal = 65.4321_f32;

    // Error! No implicit conversion
    let integer: u8 = decimal;
    // FIXME ^ Comment out this line

    // Explicit conversion
    let integer = decimal as u8;
    let character = integer as char;

    // Error! There are limitations in conversion rules.
    // A float cannot be directly converted to a char.
    let character = decimal as char;
    // FIXME ^ Comment out this line

    println!("Casting: {} -> {} -> {}", decimal, integer, character);

    // when casting any value to an unsigned type, T,
    // T::MAX + 1 is added or subtracted until the value
    // fits into the new type

    // 1000 already fits in a u16
    println!("1000 as a u16 is: {}", 1000 as u16);

    // 1000 - 256 - 256 - 256 = 232
    // Under the hood, the first 8 least significant bits (LSB) are kept,
    // while the rest towards the most significant bit (MSB) get truncated.
    println!("1000 as a u8 is : {}", 1000 as u8);
    // -1 + 256 = 255
    println!("  -1 as a u8 is : {}", (-1i8) as u8);

    // For positive numbers, this is the same as the modulus
    println!("1000 mod 256 is : {}", 1000 % 256);

    // When casting to a signed type, the (bitwise) result is the same as
    // first casting to the corresponding unsigned type. If the most significant
    // bit of that value is 1, then the value is negative.

    // Unless it already fits, of course.
    println!(" 128 as a i16 is: {}", 128 as i16);

    // In boundary case 128 value in 8-bit two's complement representation is -128
    println!(" 128 as a i8 is : {}", 128 as i8);

    // repeating the example above
    // 1000 as u8 -> 232
    println!("1000 as a u8 is : {}", 1000 as u8);
    // and the value of 232 in 8-bit two's complement representation is -24
    println!(" 232 as a i8 is : {}", 232 as i8);

    // Since Rust 1.45, the `as` keyword performs a *saturating cast*
    // when casting from float to int. If the floating point value exceeds
    // the upper bound or is less than the lower bound, the returned value
    // will be equal to the bound crossed.

    // 300.0 as u8 is 255
    println!(" 300.0 as u8 is : {}", 300.0_f32 as u8);
    // -100.0 as u8 is 0
    println!("-100.0 as u8 is : {}", -100.0_f32 as u8);
    // nan as u8 is 0
    println!("   nan as u8 is : {}", f32::NAN as u8);

    // This behavior incurs a small runtime cost and can be avoided
    // with unsafe methods, however the results might overflow and
    // return **unsound values**. Use these methods wisely:
    unsafe {
        // 300.0 as u8 is 44
        println!(" 300.0 as u8 is : {}", 300.0_f32.to_int_unchecked::<u8>());
        // -100.0 as u8 is 156
        println!("-100.0 as u8 is : {}", (-100.0_f32).to_int_unchecked::<u8>());
        // nan as u8 is 0
        println!("   nan as u8 is : {}", f32::NAN.to_int_unchecked::<u8>());
    }
}
```



================================================
FILE: src/types/inference.md
================================================
# Inference

The type inference engine is pretty smart. It does more than looking at the
type of the value expression
during an initialization. It also looks at how the variable is used afterwards
to infer its type. Here's an advanced example of type inference:

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    // Because of the annotation, the compiler knows that `elem` has type u8.
    let elem = 5u8;

    // Create an empty vector (a growable array).
    let mut vec = Vec::new();
    // At this point the compiler doesn't know the exact type of `vec`, it
    // just knows that it's a vector of something (`Vec<_>`).

    // Insert `elem` in the vector.
    vec.push(elem);
    // Aha! Now the compiler knows that `vec` is a vector of `u8`s (`Vec<u8>`)
    // TODO ^ Try commenting out the `vec.push(elem)` line

    println!("{:?}", vec);
}
```

No type annotation of variables was needed, the compiler is happy and so is the
programmer!



================================================
FILE: src/types/literals.md
================================================
# Literals

Numeric literals can be type annotated by adding the type as a suffix. As an example,
to specify that the literal `42` should have the type `i32`, write `42i32`.

The type of unsuffixed numeric literals will depend on how they are used. If no
constraint exists, the compiler will use `i32` for integers, and `f64` for
floating-point numbers.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    // Suffixed literals, their types are known at initialization
    let x = 1u8;
    let y = 2u32;
    let z = 3f32;

    // Unsuffixed literals, their types depend on how they are used
    let i = 1;
    let f = 1.0;

    // `size_of_val` returns the size of a variable in bytes
    println!("size of `x` in bytes: {}", std::mem::size_of_val(&x));
    println!("size of `y` in bytes: {}", std::mem::size_of_val(&y));
    println!("size of `z` in bytes: {}", std::mem::size_of_val(&z));
    println!("size of `i` in bytes: {}", std::mem::size_of_val(&i));
    println!("size of `f` in bytes: {}", std::mem::size_of_val(&f));
}
```

There are some concepts used in the previous code that haven't been explained
yet, here's a brief explanation for the impatient readers:

* `std::mem::size_of_val` is a function, but called with its *full path*. Code
  can be split in logical units called *modules*. In this case, the
  `size_of_val` function is defined in the `mem` module, and the `mem` module
  is defined in the `std` *crate*. For more details, see
  [modules][mod] and [crates][crate].

================================================
# Inline assembly

Rust provides support for inline assembly via the `asm!` macro.
It can be used to embed handwritten assembly in the assembly output generated by the compiler.
Generally this should not be necessary, but might be where the required performance or timing
cannot be otherwise achieved. Accessing low level hardware primitives, e.g. in kernel code, may also demand this functionality.

> **Note**: the examples here are given in x86/x86-64 assembly, but other architectures are also supported.

Inline assembly is currently supported on the following architectures:

- x86 and x86-64
- ARM
- AArch64
- RISC-V

## Basic usage

Let us start with the simplest possible example:

```rust
# #[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")] {
use std::arch::asm;

unsafe {
    asm!("nop");
}
# }
```

This will insert a NOP (no operation) instruction into the assembly generated by the compiler.
Note that all `asm!` invocations have to be inside an `unsafe` block, as they could insert
arbitrary instructions and break various invariants. The instructions to be inserted are listed
in the first argument of the `asm!` macro as a string literal.

## Inputs and outputs

Now inserting an instruction that does nothing is rather boring. Let us do something that
actually acts on data:

```rust
# #[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")] {
use std::arch::asm;

let x: u64;
unsafe {
    asm!("mov {}, 5", out(reg) x);
}
assert_eq!(x, 5);
# }
```

This will write the value `5` into the `u64` variable `x`.
You can see that the string literal we use to specify instructions is actually a template string.
It is governed by the same rules as Rust [format strings][format-syntax].
The arguments that are inserted into the template however look a bit different than you may
be familiar with. First we need to specify if the variable is an input or an output of the
inline assembly. In this case it is an output. We declared this by writing `out`.
We also need to specify in what kind of register the assembly expects the variable.
In this case we put it in an arbitrary general purpose register by specifying `reg`.
The compiler will choose an appropriate register to insert into
the template and will read the variable from there after the inline assembly finishes executing.

[format-syntax]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/#syntax

Let us see another example that also uses an input:

```rust
# #[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")] {
use std::arch::asm;

let i: u64 = 3;
let o: u64;
unsafe {
    asm!(
        "mov {0}, {1}",
        "add {0}, 5",
        out(reg) o,
        in(reg) i,
    );
}
assert_eq!(o, 8);
# }
```

This will add `5` to the input in variable `i` and write the result to variable `o`.
The particular way this assembly does this is first copying the value from `i` to the output,
and then adding `5` to it.

The example shows a few things:

First, we can see that `asm!` allows multiple template string arguments; each
one is treated as a separate line of assembly code, as if they were all joined
together with newlines between them. This makes it easy to format assembly
code.

Second, we can see that inputs are declared by writing `in` instead of `out`.

Third, we can see that we can specify an argument number, or name as in any format string.
For inline assembly templates this is particularly useful as arguments are often used more than once.
For more complex inline assembly using this facility is generally recommended, as it improves
readability, and allows reordering instructions without changing the argument order.

We can further refine the above example to avoid the `mov` instruction:

```rust
# #[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")] {
use std::arch::asm;

let mut x: u64 = 3;
unsafe {
    asm!("add {0}, 5", inout(reg) x);
}
assert_eq!(x, 8);
# }
```

We can see that `inout` is used to specify an argument that is both input and output.
This is different from specifying an input and output separately in that it is guaranteed to assign both to the same register.

It is also possible to specify different variables for the input and output parts of an `inout` operand:

```rust
# #[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")] {
use std::arch::asm;

let x: u64 = 3;
let y: u64;
unsafe {
    asm!("add {0}, 5", inout(reg) x => y);
}
assert_eq!(y, 8);
# }
```

## Late output operands

The Rust compiler is conservative with its allocation of operands. It is assumed that an `out`
can be written at any time, and can therefore not share its location with any other argument.
However, to guarantee optimal performance it is important to use as few registers as possible,
so they won't have to be saved and reloaded around the inline assembly block.
To achieve this Rust provides a `lateout` specifier. This can be used on any output that is
written only after all inputs have been consumed. There is also an `inlateout` variant of this
specifier.

Here is an example where `inlateout` *cannot* be used in `release` mode or other optimized cases:

```rust
# #[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")] {
use std::arch::asm;

let mut a: u64 = 4;
let b: u64 = 4;
let c: u64 = 4;
unsafe {
    asm!(
        "add {0}, {1}",
        "add {0}, {2}",
        inout(reg) a,
        in(reg) b,
        in(reg) c,
    );
}
assert_eq!(a, 12);
# }
```

In unoptimized cases (e.g. `Debug` mode), replacing `inout(reg) a` with `inlateout(reg) a` in the
above example can continue to give the expected result. However, with `release` mode or other
optimized cases, using `inlateout(reg) a` can instead lead to the final value `a = 16`, causing the
assertion to fail.

This is because in optimized cases, the compiler is free to allocate the same register for inputs
`b` and `c` since it knows that they have the same value. Furthermore, when `inlateout` is used, `a`
and `c` could be allocated to the same register, in which case the first `add` instruction would
overwrite the initial load from variable `c`. This is in contrast to how using `inout(reg) a`
ensures a separate register is allocated for `a`.

However, the following example can use `inlateout` since the output is only modified after all input
registers have been read:

```rust
# #[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")] {
use std::arch::asm;

let mut a: u64 = 4;
let b: u64 = 4;
unsafe {
    asm!("add {0}, {1}", inlateout(reg) a, in(reg) b);
}
assert_eq!(a, 8);
# }
```

As you can see, this assembly fragment will still work correctly if `a` and `b` are assigned to the same register.

## Explicit register operands

Some instructions require that the operands be in a specific register.
Therefore, Rust inline assembly provides some more specific constraint specifiers.
While `reg` is generally available on any architecture, explicit registers are highly architecture specific. E.g. for x86 the general purpose registers `eax`, `ebx`, `ecx`, `edx`, `ebp`, `esi`, and `edi` among others can be addressed by their name.

```rust,no_run
# #[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")] {
use std::arch::asm;

let cmd = 0xd1;
unsafe {
    asm!("out 0x64, eax", in("eax") cmd);
}
# }
```

In this example we call the `out` instruction to output the content of the `cmd` variable to port `0x64`. Since the `out` instruction only accepts `eax` (and its sub registers) as operand we had to use the `eax` constraint specifier.

> **Note**: unlike other operand types, explicit register operands cannot be used in the template string: you can't use `{}` and should write the register name directly instead. Also, they must appear at the end of the operand list after all other operand types.

Consider this example which uses the x86 `mul` instruction:

```rust
# #[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")] {
use std::arch::asm;

fn mul(a: u64, b: u64) -> u128 {
    let lo: u64;
    let hi: u64;

    unsafe {
        asm!(
            // The x86 mul instruction takes rax as an implicit input and writes
            // the 128-bit result of the multiplication to rax:rdx.
            "mul {}",
            in(reg) a,
            inlateout("rax") b => lo,
            lateout("rdx") hi
        );
    }

    ((hi as u128) << 64) + lo as u128
}
# }
```

This uses the `mul` instruction to multiply two 64-bit inputs with a 128-bit result.
The only explicit operand is a register, that we fill from the variable `a`.
The second operand is implicit, and must be the `rax` register, which we fill from the variable `b`.
The lower 64 bits of the result are stored in `rax` from which we fill the variable `lo`.
The higher 64 bits are stored in `rdx` from which we fill the variable `hi`.

## Clobbered registers

In many cases inline assembly will modify state that is not needed as an output.
Usually this is either because we have to use a scratch register in the assembly or because instructions modify state that we don't need to further examine.
This state is generally referred to as being "clobbered".
We need to tell the compiler about this since it may need to save and restore this state around the inline assembly block.

```rust
use std::arch::asm;

# #[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")]
fn main() {
    // three entries of four bytes each
    let mut name_buf = [0_u8; 12];
    // String is stored as ascii in ebx, edx, ecx in order
    // Because ebx is reserved, the asm needs to preserve the value of it.
    // So we push and pop it around the main asm.
    // 64 bit mode on 64 bit processors does not allow pushing/popping of
    // 32 bit registers (like ebx), so we have to use the extended rbx register instead.

    unsafe {
        asm!(
            "push rbx",
            "cpuid",
            "mov [rdi], ebx",
            "mov [rdi + 4], edx",
            "mov [rdi + 8], ecx",
            "pop rbx",
            // We use a pointer to an array for storing the values to simplify
            // the Rust code at the cost of a couple more asm instructions
            // This is more explicit with how the asm works however, as opposed
            // to explicit register outputs such as `out("ecx") val`
            // The *pointer itself* is only an input even though it's written behind
            in("rdi") name_buf.as_mut_ptr(),
            // select cpuid 0, also specify eax as clobbered
            inout("eax") 0 => _,
            // cpuid clobbers these registers too
            out("ecx") _,
            out("edx") _,
        );
    }

    let name = core::str::from_utf8(&name_buf).unwrap();
    println!("CPU Manufacturer ID: {}", name);
}

# #[cfg(not(target_arch = "x86_64"))]
# fn main() {}
```

In the example above we use the `cpuid` instruction to read the CPU manufacturer ID.
This instruction writes to `eax` with the maximum supported `cpuid` argument and `ebx`, `edx`, and `ecx` with the CPU manufacturer ID as ASCII bytes in that order.

Even though `eax` is never read we still need to tell the compiler that the register has been modified so that the compiler can save any values that were in these registers before the asm. This is done by declaring it as an output but with `_` instead of a variable name, which indicates that the output value is to be discarded.

This code also works around the limitation that `ebx` is a reserved register by LLVM. That means that LLVM assumes that it has full control over the register and it must be restored to its original state before exiting the asm block, so it cannot be used as an input or output **except** if the compiler uses it to fulfill a general register class (e.g. `in(reg)`). This makes `reg` operands dangerous when using reserved registers as we could unknowingly corrupt our input or output because they share the same register.

To work around this we use `rdi` to store the pointer to the output array, save `ebx` via `push`, read from `ebx` inside the asm block into the array and then restore `ebx` to its original state via `pop`. The `push` and `pop` use the full 64-bit `rbx` version of the register to ensure that the entire register is saved. On 32 bit targets the code would instead use `ebx` in the `push`/`pop`.

This can also be used with a general register class to obtain a scratch register for use inside the asm code:

```rust
# #[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")] {
use std::arch::asm;

// Multiply x by 6 using shifts and adds
let mut x: u64 = 4;
unsafe {
    asm!(
        "mov {tmp}, {x}",
        "shl {tmp}, 1",
        "shl {x}, 2",
        "add {x}, {tmp}",
        x = inout(reg) x,
        tmp = out(reg) _,
    );
}
assert_eq!(x, 4 * 6);
# }
```

## Symbol operands and ABI clobbers

By default, `asm!` assumes that any register not specified as an output will have its contents preserved by the assembly code. The [`clobber_abi`] argument to `asm!` tells the compiler to automatically insert the necessary clobber operands according to the given calling convention ABI: any register which is not fully preserved in that ABI will be treated as clobbered.  Multiple `clobber_abi` arguments may be provided and all clobbers from all specified ABIs will be inserted.

[`clobber_abi`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/inline-assembly.html#abi-clobbers

```rust
# #[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")] {
use std::arch::asm;

extern "C" fn foo(arg: i32) -> i32 {
    println!("arg = {}", arg);
    arg * 2
}

fn call_foo(arg: i32) -> i32 {
    unsafe {
        let result;

        result
    }

## Register template modifiers

In some cases, fine control is needed over the way a register name is formatted when inserted into the template string. This is needed when an architecture's assembly language has several names for the same register, each typically being a "view" over a subset of the register (e.g. the low 32 bits of a 64-bit register).

By default the compiler will always choose the name that refers to the full register size (e.g. `rax` on x86-64, `eax` on x86, etc).

This default can be overridden by using modifiers on the template string operands, just like you would with format strings:

```rust
# #[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")] {
use std::arch::asm;

let mut x: u16 = 0xab;

unsafe {
    asm!("mov {0:h}, {0:l}", inout(reg_abcd) x);
}

assert_eq!(x, 0xabab);
# }
```

In this example, we use the `reg_abcd` register class to restrict the register allocator to the 4 legacy x86 registers (`ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `dx`) of which the first two bytes can be addressed independently.

Let us assume that the register allocator has chosen to allocate `x` in the `ax` register.
The `h` modifier will emit the register name for the high byte of that register and the `l` modifier will emit the register name for the low byte. The asm code will therefore be expanded as `mov ah, al` which copies the low byte of the value into the high byte.

If you use a smaller data type (e.g. `u16`) with an operand and forget to use template modifiers, the compiler will emit a warning and suggest the correct modifier to use.

## Memory address operands

Sometimes assembly instructions require operands passed via memory addresses/memory locations.
You have to manually use the memory address syntax specified by the target architecture.
For example, on x86/x86_64 using Intel assembly syntax, you should wrap inputs/outputs in `[]` to indicate they are memory operands:

```rust
# #[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")] {
use std::arch::asm;

fn load_fpu_control_word(control: u16) {
    unsafe {
        asm!("fldcw [{}]", in(reg) &control, options(nostack));
    }
}
# }
```

## Labels

Any reuse of a named label, local or otherwise, can result in an assembler or linker error or may cause other strange behavior. Reuse of a named label can happen in a variety of ways including:

- explicitly: using a label more than once in one `asm!` block, or multiple times across blocks.
- implicitly via inlining: the compiler is allowed to instantiate multiple copies of an `asm!` block, for example when the function containing it is inlined in multiple places.
- implicitly via LTO: LTO can cause code from *other crates* to be placed in the same codegen unit, and so could bring in arbitrary labels.

As a consequence, you should only use GNU assembler **numeric** [local labels] inside inline assembly code. Defining symbols in assembly code may lead to assembler and/or linker errors due to duplicate symbol definitions.

Moreover, on x86 when using the default Intel syntax, due to [an LLVM bug], you shouldn't use labels exclusively made of `0` and `1` digits, e.g. `0`, `11` or `101010`, as they may end up being interpreted as binary values. Using `options(att_syntax)` will avoid any ambiguity, but that affects the syntax of the *entire* `asm!` block. (See [Options](#options), below, for more on `options`.)

```rust
# #[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")] {
use std::arch::asm;

let mut a = 0;
unsafe {
    asm!(
        "mov {0}, 10",
        "2:",
        "sub {0}, 1",
        "cmp {0}, 3",
        "jle 2f",
        "jmp 2b",
        "2:",
        "add {0}, 2",
        out(reg) a
    );
}
assert_eq!(a, 5);
# }
```

This will decrement the `{0}` register value from 10 to 3, then add 2 and store it in `a`.

This example shows a few things:

- First, that the same number can be used as a label multiple times in the same inline block.
- Second, that when a numeric label is used as a reference (as an instruction operand, for example), the suffixes “b” (“backward”) or ”f” (“forward”) should be added to the numeric label. It will then refer to the nearest label defined by this number in this direction.

[an LLVM bug]: https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36144

## Options {#options}

By default, an inline assembly block is treated the same way as an external FFI function call with a custom calling convention: it may read/write memory, have observable side effects, etc. However, in many cases it is desirable to give the compiler more information about what the assembly code is actually doing so that it can optimize better.

Let's take our previous example of an `add` instruction:

```rust
# #[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")] {
use std::arch::asm;

let mut a: u64 = 4;
let b: u64 = 4;
unsafe {
    asm!(
        "add {0}, {1}",
        inlateout(reg) a, in(reg) b,
        options(pure, nomem, nostack),
    );
}
assert_eq!(a, 8);
# }
```

Options can be provided as an optional final argument to the `asm!` macro. We specified three options here:

- `pure` means that the asm code has no observable side effects and that its output depends only on its inputs. This allows the compiler optimizer to call the inline asm fewer times or even eliminate it entirely.
- `nomem` means that the asm code does not read or write to memory. By default the compiler will assume that inline assembly can read or write any memory address that is accessible to it (e.g. through a pointer passed as an operand, or a global).
- `nostack` means that the asm code does not push any data onto the stack. This allows the compiler to use optimizations such as the stack red zone on x86-64 to avoid stack pointer adjustments.

These allow the compiler to better optimize code using `asm!`, for example by eliminating pure `asm!` blocks whose outputs are not needed.

See the [reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/inline-assembly.html) for the full list of available options and their effects.

================================================
# Declare first

It is possible to declare variable bindings first and initialize them later, but all variable bindings must be initialized before they are used: the compiler forbids use of uninitialized variable bindings, as it would lead to undefined behavior.

It is not common to declare a variable binding and initialize it later in the function.
It is more difficult for a reader to find the initialization when initialization is separated from declaration.
It is common to declare and initialize a variable binding near where the variable will be used.

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
fn main() {
    // Declare a variable binding
    let a_binding;

    {
        let x = 2;

        // Initialize the binding
        a_binding = x * x;
    }

    println!("a binding: {}", a_binding);

    let another_binding;

    // Error! Use of uninitialized binding
    println!("another binding: {}", another_binding);
    // FIXME ^ Comment out this line

    another_binding = 1;

    println!("another binding: {}", another_binding);
}
```





================================================
FILE: src/variable_bindings/freeze.md
================================================
# Freezing

When data is bound by the same name immutably, it also *freezes*. *Frozen* data can't be
modified until the immutable binding goes out of scope:

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
fn main() {
    let mut _mutable_integer = 7i32;

    {
        // Shadowing by immutable `_mutable_integer`
        let _mutable_integer = _mutable_integer;

        // Error! `_mutable_integer` is frozen in this scope
        _mutable_integer = 50;
        // FIXME ^ Comment out this line

        // `_mutable_integer` goes out of scope
    }

    // Ok! `_mutable_integer` is not frozen in this scope
    _mutable_integer = 3;
}
```



================================================
FILE: src/variable_bindings/mut.md
================================================
# Mutability

Variable bindings are immutable by default, but this can be overridden using
the `mut` modifier.

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
fn main() {
    let _immutable_binding = 1;
    let mut mutable_binding = 1;

    println!("Before mutation: {}", mutable_binding);

    // Ok
    mutable_binding += 1;

    println!("After mutation: {}", mutable_binding);

    // Error! Cannot assign a new value to an immutable variable
    _immutable_binding += 1;
}
```

The compiler will throw a detailed diagnostic about mutability errors.



================================================
FILE: src/variable_bindings/scope.md
================================================
# Scope and Shadowing

Variable bindings have a scope, and are constrained to live in a *block*. A
block is a collection of statements enclosed by braces `{}`.

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
fn main() {
    // This binding lives in the main function
    let long_lived_binding = 1;

    // This is a block, and has a smaller scope than the main function
    {
        // This binding only exists in this block
        let short_lived_binding = 2;

        println!("inner short: {}", short_lived_binding);
    }
    // End of the block

    // Error! `short_lived_binding` doesn't exist in this scope
    println!("outer short: {}", short_lived_binding);
    // FIXME ^ Comment out this line

    println!("outer long: {}", long_lived_binding);
}
```

Also, [variable shadowing][variable-shadow] is allowed.

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
fn main() {
    let shadowed_binding = 1;

    {
        println!("before being shadowed: {}", shadowed_binding);

        // This binding *shadows* the outer one
        let shadowed_binding = "abc";

        println!("shadowed in inner block: {}", shadowed_binding);
    }
    println!("outside inner block: {}", shadowed_binding);

    // This binding *shadows* the previous binding
    let shadowed_binding = 2;
    println!("shadowed in outer block: {}", shadowed_binding);
}
```
