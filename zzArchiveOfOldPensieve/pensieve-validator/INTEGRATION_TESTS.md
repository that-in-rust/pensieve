- âœ… Performance regression detection across multiple runs
- âœ… Different pensieve configurations (default, high-performance, comprehensive)
- âœ… Report generation in multiple formats (JSON, HTML, CSV)
- âœ… Validation framework performance testing
- âœ… Error aggregation and comprehensive reporting
- âœ… Historical trend analysis across validation runs

**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive test data generator with chaotic directory structures
- Mock pensieve runner for testing without actual pensieve binary

- Slow operation with feature overhead
- Memory-heavy operation with high resource usage
- Error-prone operation with random failures
- Crashy operation with instability
- Inconsistent output with varying formats
